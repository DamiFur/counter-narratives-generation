Deporting people seeking asylum (victims of human trafficking, natural disasters, wars) is inhuman. Not being humans is worse than a small burden to our financial system

You cannot prove that they have been in the country for more than one year. Besides, what's your problem with us being supportive of them? They are not hurting anyone anyway....

The money that states spend on refugees is really low and is not the cause of children starving. Have you thought about other possible causes for this like war and military budgets, tax exemptions for multinational companies and allowance for companies to cut wages and fire employees at will?

Refugees are granted asylum because their life is in danger or they can not go back to their homes. It doesn't matter if they have a job or not, you are not wasting money, you are saving someone
