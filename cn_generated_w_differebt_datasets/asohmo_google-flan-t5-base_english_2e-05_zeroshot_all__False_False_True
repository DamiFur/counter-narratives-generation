I am asking people to understand that the US government does not recognize the right of people to have their countries in their own country, and that the government is not obligated to treat everyone who enter that country. I have not read all of them. I have no desire to impose some of the laws stating that people should not have access to their homelands. But I have read some of those laws. I have also read some laws regarding immigration from other countries, but I have not found any evidence of that a person is a Canadian citizen. I am also asking that people who enter and leave their country should not have their countries invaded.</s>tic states have been a factor in immigration since the US left the world in the early 1980's.</s>tic will continue to enforce immigration laws for decades.</s>tic courts and immigration tribunals ruled that those laws should be enforced.
