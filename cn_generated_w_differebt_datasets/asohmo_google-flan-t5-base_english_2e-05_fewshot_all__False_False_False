The money that states spend on refugees is really low and is not the cause of children starving. Have you thought about other possible causes for this like war and military budgets, tax exemptions for multinational companies and allowance for companies to cut wages and fire employees at will?

Though the responsability of the former colonial powers in the refugee crisis is true, it is not true that refugees and migrants can not be taken into the Euro Zone. If there are resources for war, there must be resources for aid

Not necessarily Muslims, and I don't think all of them. In any case, the reason is that this is the way they dressed all their lives, and not because they wanted to be "ghosts".
