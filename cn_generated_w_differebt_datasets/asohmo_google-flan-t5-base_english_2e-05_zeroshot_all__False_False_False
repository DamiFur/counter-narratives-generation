Being humanitarian in interpreting the law is not the same as allowing someone to game the immigration system. Who cares if someone takes a little while to complete their paperwork...everyone does it.

It's almost a pun that you expect "illegals" to play by your rules. In any case, it would make more sense to establish mechanisms by which to legalize them, don't you think? But of course, that implies accepting immigrants...

Not necessarily Muslims, and I don't think all of them. In any case, the reason is that this is the way they dressed all their lives, and not because they wanted to be "ghosts".
