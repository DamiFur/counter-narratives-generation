Most USA citizens earn much much more than immigrants and refugees who accept low paid works that others won't because they are desperate

If a group of immigrants in the Netherlands started fighting, killed security forces and demanded land to form their own government, we would have to analyze the case, and see how to proceed.

It's almost a pun that you expect "illegals" to play by your rules. In any case, it would make more sense to establish mechanisms by which to legalize them, don't you think? But of course, that implies accepting immigrants...

8% is a minor percentage, don't you think? About welfare, maybe it wouldn't be necessary if they were allowed to work.

You assume they don't want to have a job and they want to live from social walfare. Many times they can not work or people don't want to hire them. We are talking about people escaping extreme situations, they do what they can.

<pad> False observation.</s>idalia news outlets carried the most unfortunate stories of personal encounters with insurgents, particularly the southerners. Twitter let the majority see the story as a subversive counter attack in foreign governments’ efforts to access statehood. The news outlets do not always favor the right of international extremists to vote on inflammatory topics such as terrorism, the bombing of Russia, the Assad regime, the torture of clerics and fighters.
