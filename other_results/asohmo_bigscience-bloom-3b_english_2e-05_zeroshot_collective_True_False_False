"Much of what people find so offensive about a lot of music is just tone. Whether it is humor, irony or some other kind of rip-off or mess-up in a particular track, it is most often in the word choice.

"The one caveat to making a “self-prosecution” argument is that true behavior based on assumptions can become undetectable through replication of what was initially disseminated. Why would an attacker want to seek out the best chances to commit her cyber attack against a victim in a community where these threats are not obvious? To the extent that it is important to state that the attacker wanted to ensure that the attack was undetectable, then the assumption, that somehow making a reference to the attack, would reveal the attacker’s identity, is not correct." | Stew Stone - PI:EMAIL | Cause: You are a dark person.

1. We're also really hoping to get more people's attention to this to tell them this won't happen. This is what's working on PI:USER
Our filter is great, but it's by design. The problem is that real users don't always appear on the screen and the same user can post in more than one thread.
We therefore need to identify all users that appear and replicate the post.
As of now we're approaching this in the hopes that eventually we'll have a more specific way to select threads where we want to filter.
2. I'm worried about some of the comments in this thread. It has been about all life forms, for instance:  →,
3. Europe supports same-sex marriage all over the world so it has no right to be anti-rape law. PI:USER

4. Europe is a giant joke. How could any people be surprised by the overthinking coming from countries like your US, where you so clearly do not exist?
Honestly, I think if Europe put all their attention on buying Russian things and how it affected the economy, they'd never find out it was a global issue.

5. Europe should get some backers that want them in and they are being allowed to invest in the future.
It's about respecting people's rights. The United States would like to see this happening. Let's just see if it can happen and the rest will fall into place.

6. Europe will probably not welcome 11 million Syrian refugees (that we will refuse to admit). - EU is defined by the atrocities of its past.
Refugees are those who want to escape oppression and pain. We welcome them. They have nothing

What's the difference between racism and anti-racism?
Usually, racism is due to ignorance about human nature, or to prejudice of a specific ethnic group.  Ideologically based racist sentiments rarely come up for discussion as hatred of any ethnicity is strictly against the law in most countries.
Anti-racism involves a discussion about the causes, consequences, and possibly solutions of anti-racism. It is the only way to remove this horrible, selfish attitude from people's minds.
This, by the way, is the description of racism in the United States Constitution.
From Wikipedia, Wikipedia, and Wikipedia again:

Anti-racist thought examines racial stereotyping, prejudice, and racism, and also may address questions of what white privilege means to people of color, racial equity and systemic oppression; as well as the intersection of racism and white privilege with people of color.

Meanwhile, the Science Online Encyclopedia, explains racism as "the process of considering races as categories distinct from one another, and thinking that a society based on those categories has structure and problems separate from its members."
Anti-racists are, in essence, blackists and the Webopedia define blackists as follows:

[Blackists] are those interested in the aesthetics, research, teaching, and research of black literature, society, culture and its phenomena, primarily of African origin and of African-American descent.

They, for example, advocate the abolition of discriminatory racial laws and policies that exclude black people from certain goods and services, as well as support the efforts to end racial tension.

How to respond to racist hate?

Don't be a dumb bound
Tell Trump to knit someone a hat. Your knitting skill is about 2 centimetres long
3. This is almost ridiculous. It's absolutely ridiculous how Trump stated that he is not going to appoint a permanent MAGA lawyer, and that you would find someone that would "bear the ring."
No, because of his past actions I just can't see how any lawyer is going to be able to represent him during the impeachment proceedings. He walked through the Democrat wards talking about their thefts of the 2016 election and doing the "unfortunate man" speech to those that voted against his nomination.
4. Always ask yourself if what you have said is based on true knowledge. If your answer is no, I would like to offer some positive factual evidence.
If Trump is going to resign, and the country chooses to replace him, does that mean that the current president will resign? The answer is yes, he will. He chose not to resign, I believe him and support him, and this is how we do things in a democratic country.
When Trump said something to support the #hackedoutlaws campaign, he said the USA is a big country and has not been attacked. There are million of votes worth of evidence pointing to that. The USA was never attacked, no gas attacks were ever carried out in the US. His claim has never been documented. It is ridiculous to compare this to the recent attack on democracy. The country is strong, protected by this insurrection.
5. You can take your time and read documents and resources for yourself.

Yet another definition of #YouAreJustLikeMe 🤣🤣🥲🇹🇷 We call him uneducated but he actually is not he is very educated. We call him a conservative but he doesn’t support any policies because all he thinks is about owning you and being the most corrupt and criminal. 😪😂We call him naive but he is pretty sophisticated you have to be uneducated to have 3 kids. You shouldn’t complain because he actually is such a smart person but a smart person cannot protect you. 🙋🏻‍&female;️ You are exactly like me. 😂🤣 His stupidity lasts up to three years. 🙊😂But one day he’ll realize he is the only one who can save his life. 🤣

Hildebrandt, your goal is just not likely to be achieved. 
The fact that Germany was in WW2 is irrelevant and does not make you a superior ethnical or racial being. 
Germans fought and died to save Germany from its Nazi enemies, but they did not protect anybody from another, or any other people.
That is simply not the case. While being who they are, Germans should share the suffering

We have always worked to provide an exceptional service for our patients, and the benefits we offer to support care for our NHS colleagues will not be lost.
During the current crisis, we are working closely with local residents and key partners to set up more temporary community food provision points at key key points of the city. This means that people who need to find essential food will now be able to access fresh, locally sourced groceries on their own.

Build a wall. Let millions of immigrants in. Buy a mansion. Lots of art. Republican infighting. It's The Orville in a nutshell.
We are disgusted and appalled by Donald Trump's racist remarks as president of the U.S. Regardless of what his false evidence may be, I have doubts about Trump's ability to balance those opinions and distinguish between right and wrong, and to see how his statements could lead to violence. I've chosen not to comment further, which seems to be a common response to Trump's hate speech. According to NPR, "Trump's remarks were disrespectful to millions of immigrants," adding, "The president has no idea what racism is or what immigrants are, or the kind of harm it can cause."
In reality, however, Trump's support of building a southern border wall is supported by President Obama and other Americans of all races and faiths. Immigrants are not broken down by race. Those who demand that immigrants be removed from their country are living in denial and the United States has been invaded by others for thousands of years. In addition, there are widespread people whose number is higher than the number of immigrants. On a smaller scale, millions of jobs and millions of resources have been taken from America by Muslims, Arabs, and others who would rather be treated like the rest of humanity.</s>

Build a wall. Let millions of immigrants in. Buy a mansion. Lots of art. Republican infighting. It's The Orville in a nutshell.
We are disgusted and appalled by Donald Trump's racist remarks as president of the U.S. Regardless of what his false evidence may be, I have doubts about Trump's ability to balance those opinions and distinguish between right and wrong, and to see how his statements could lead to violence. I've chosen not to comment further, which seems to be a common response to Trump's hate speech. According to NPR, "Trump's remarks were disrespectful to millions of immigrants," adding, "The president has no idea what racism is or what immigrants are, or the kind of harm it can cause."
In reality, however, Trump's support of building a southern border wall is supported by President Obama and other Americans of all races and faiths. Immigrants are not broken down by race. Those who demand that immigrants be removed from their country are living in denial and the United States has been invaded by others for thousands of years. In addition, there are widespread people whose number is higher than the number of immigrants. On a smaller scale, millions of jobs and millions of resources have been taken from America by Muslims, Arabs, and others who would rather be treated like the rest of humanity.</s>

# Match all the hashtags that are NOT in the list #

When you change user selection, your program stops working.  No more will they turn up as correct answers.
Setting voting to false and correcting their answers will tell them the answer was wrong.  I would like to see an option to continue to vote on all old answers if it was already wrong, and that option should allow users to correct an answer that they have already voted

One woman left India by the end of the 1970s, and sent her children into the wilds of Pakistan. Only after the sons’ younger siblings were killed by the home attacks in Karachi, did she finally send the youngest son on his own to a visa-free country. The 2-year-old had already managed to make his way across the border in his suitcase, with only a hand grenade on his hip. Nidhi Sumeru tells In Touch: “I was amazed at the quality of life he enjoyed. It was very safe, very civilised.” Although the busloads of families sent across the border may seem daunting, some 2.1 million people crossed that border every year.

No education = no option @theresa Unicut Thoue @micharghinebit it is true , that education is the key to all change and if its interrupted , the achievement levels are stagnant (minto everything is measured by ability since its always limited) so now is the time to address this in the schools and even to refer to the pension and disability system as children and even elderly should know, to what other system they should be applying and that many are in danger of being sent off to the Disability System of Taiwan or sometimes the abuser can take her name off the paper leaving them no identity at all. In this case , we are left with money stealing illegals to support the working poor in the US to the detriment of the kidneys of the elderly , this is what this community looks like after decades of foolishness. @wastamind all hopes is no hope for us and no hope will change nothing so do something , ask your authority to speak up for you , you cant just live this life like you are one of them without being a

Nice! Ahead of an upcoming European Union summit, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Boyko Borisov today said the EU and countries in the region should refrain from “stalling” the arrangement, instead opening a dialogue with Russia on restoring a stable situation in the East.
Last Thursday European Union leaders gathered in Brussels for talks on how to solve the Ukraine crisis. The discussion will turn to whether a new mechanism should be established, and, if so, under what circumstances.

Therefore, thanks to the Internet, it is now possible to follow the development of female roles in contemporary Western societies. These have been dismantled in favor of the male role and generally modern ideas. Women, in theory, not only enjoy more rights in Western countries, but also play a more active role. These roles are significantly different from what they were in the earlier times when there was only one type of wife or concubine. Modern women are often called “support women” or “self-described engineers,” as well as architects and scientists. Nowadays, it is the responsibility of the woman to lead her family, but mainly to work on a professional basis. Women and men are considered as equally valuable and valuable talents in the way of utilizing their skills and abilities. The fact that only the man in many situations is considered a source of income means that the decisions in the family can be made by women, but in return, she does not have the freedom of the former. Researchers, even taking into account the obvious negative aspects, prove the advantages of the modern role of the wife. It is especially the support role of the woman that is appreciated. She supports

I respect anyone's right to disagree but, to suggest the overall purpose of the operation is to pay homage to the Men in black is one too big a myth to be true. You can't pretend the man who invented the first film would go out of his way to pay homages to and thank people who, right now, create my life hell. I don't know why you care.
To his credit, Debbie has a knack for reading people's mind (I don't have to explain that any more than I've already explained to you that I don't actually think TOTSM is racist, but I will take you to a place where I do have to anyway). Still, I have no doubt that most of you would feel wiped out by a White cube, even if you were yourself part of that institution. It's not a struggle I feel comfortable with.
I'm pretty well known as someone who made a lot of my money legitimately, and to those who are truly concerned about the need for genuine capital gains taxation, they would feel alone. But the other part of me, that doesn't want to see the country disappear, would be quite open to a resolution which would effectively give citizenship to 6.2 million people. This would mean my inherited home was left unpaid, and a few square feet would have to be sacrificed in an effort to better the world. Which would hurt, but I don't see this being a way forward for everyone.
Secondly, I am absolutely delighted that this conversation will lead to the empowerment of minorities, and the increased ability to give people access to the goods that so many of us have been denied. If racism is still a problem in the country, or, more accurately, in this city, then it's a problem that needs to be addressed. Nobody is saying it isn't a problem. As someone who is looking forward to the day when all my neighbours are citizens, I don't want to feel like it's happening only to me. The NW1K attack and the ongoing fight to get disability cover back to all kinds of people, aren't my issues. They are people who deserve these improvements.
Secondly, although the ability to walk around London with flags which identify as gay and make me feel comfortable would certainly enhance the enjoyment of life for the average guy, it really doesn't add anything to the effort of the thousands of victims of identity

Cifilar's hate detection test did have a hit (and their hit rate was all over the place on the API docs) when it came to the US hate map but it didn't seem very effective against German language hate page text. There's a thread on the Meta.SO list here that discusses their test and suggests that the challenge here comes down to the very nature of German hate page text as opposed to the US map.
So do you find it difficult to deem a hate page part of the hated language community? Are there other languages you haven't seen previously that would help you in your vetting process (to rule out sources that may not be official, they said that they often see hate language from "undeclared" sources, but no names were given)?</s>

Cifilar's hate detection test did have a hit (and their hit rate was all over the place on the API docs) when it came to the US hate map but it didn't seem very effective against German language hate page text. There's a thread on the Meta.SO list here that discusses their test and suggests that the challenge here comes down to the very nature of German hate page text as opposed to the US map.
So do you find it difficult to deem a hate page part of the hated language community? Are there other languages you haven't seen previously that would help you in your vetting process (to rule out sources that may not be official, they said that they often see hate language from "undeclared" sources, but no names were given)?</s>

Here are my suggestion to your event:

something to say about the exceptional circumstances to which we all respond
tell some positive things about Australia, things we have come to believe in in the past 5 years.
For example, we are still in shock by the number of jobs for refugees. If any one is going to be doing it, it is Australia.
We are all working together on our plans, such as funding for services, promoting more open spaces. We were always open to the possibility of getting more refugees.
More on working together on opportunities:

We are all in this together as a united community. We will take care of each other as we all work to help one another.
We are always open to new ideas to better the quality of life of all. We are working on not only the immigration policy, but also jobs, health, housing, education, wellbeing, economics and much more.

While there may have been a disproportionate amount of racist comments posted by black people, maybe it was due to the disproportionate number of black people who put up with these incidents.

A:

Apart from racism, if you dig into the reasons people choose to send hate mail to each other, they're quite similar.
For me, I went to an online mailing list where people would post it, the other people would click on it, read it and ask questions. The list would go up and down with people commenting and also without people commenting. I was always surprised to see how casual people would be in it. Or if I complained to my co-workers about it, they'd say "But they still write emails and then we get all mad that someone is sending the messages...". I understand how that might be.
On the internet it's sometimes hard to know who's there, or who's not. But if we had a different system to contact them if we needed help (i.e. Facebook), we would have a more benign and trustworthy system. With other people, we don't have this support system. Or it doesn't apply when we write things in online forums or emails.

A:

Its incredibly silly and sad to observe people that think it's OK to jump on the emails like dogs/cats jumping on fire.
I suppose you could argue that a year ago it was fine to send people propaganda materials without permission, but you cannot, here, call it propaganda.
The simple fact of it is that people were making out that illegal aliens are allowed to live here just because they can't prove they came here legally and by that it's easy to prove them were not here legally (given all the rules of immigration that made it impossible to legally come here), so that everyone sees it differently. 
Today, they make up more to defend their positions.
I realise you have a point when it comes to the young people. To imagine that they are quite innocent when they were turning up with dirty hands.
Unfortunately they want to keep those dirty hands on that funny paper that we have.
At least the kids at the point you complain about can do what a proper adult does.
Fix it, don't let it be a problem.

Sometimes, hate speech is subtle. In some tweets, the tone is mild and doesn't strike the eye as hateful. There are cases when the term "black" is used to suggest "ethnicity". But some "black" (it is unclear how many of these were written by whites) was actually a cryptic reference to "Black people."
Another form of linguistic blackmail is for "white people" to rewrite racial slurs to suggest "black people." For example, the tweet below sounds like it was written by a white person, but it actually meant "black women" in the sense of women of a certain race, not necessarily black people in general. This type of linguistic blackming is common in our nation's discourse. See the tweet below for example:
But when blacks "only want to support their own, theyвЂ™ve killed quite a few politicians too," they said in its 2014 Truth in Policing report. The report pointed out that just 54 black police were killed in 2014, compared to approximately 400 whites and 100 Hispanics. In a 2015 paper in Urbanjustice, Rebekah Mahoney and others found similar results with black people. They found that black police were rarely referred to as "black," "black Americans" or even "black people" and many were reported to speak only of their ethnic group. One pattern here is that, again, when it appears that some of this hate language is directed at black people in particular, some of it may actually be directed at black police. As a result, it is important to not overinterpret such messages. Their ultimate effect on societal cohesion may very well be way more subtle than what we as humans can determine with our present insights.
Red Tape Appeared on the Capitol
In 2015, a woman named Stephanie Kornhauser led a small group of activists into the Capitol building and attempted to use red tape to gather a secret police, which was then allegedly used against her, the press and leftist media. It seems that once this story gained momentum and political support, anti-SLAPP lawsuits were brought, which resulted in the D.C. grand jury investigating. In a short document, the grand jury dismissed one lawsuit, saying it was likely unfounded. Another lawsuit is currently pending before

You take your infrastructure engineering responsibilities and you shut your eyes to potential problems that you may not have seen, if you adopt the advice of an infrastructure white hat.
An infrastructure white hat will begin the journey of finding problems that your organization has not recognized, that you may have missed, and building a solution that addresses them.
This is why the most successful enterprise infrastructure services providers invest in infrastructure white hat programs.</s>

So the most significant intervention by the UAC is, when the commenter does not apologize to another user or the criminal response of the other commenter is taken seriously. The two are separate interventions. However, there's a potential problem with this approach. The UAC is just not asking this user to come to the forefront and explain, and telling it to the community how to stop saying these kinds of insults. That kind of intervention might lead the other commenters to see, yes, they also used racist language, and they don't have to care if they are asked to change it. Hence, this might get the "open" (and bad) air. And the criminal response also goes against human nature - we are always afraid of the negative consequences of our actions. But these are different things. Just thinking about the negative consequences does not lead to the unpleasant emotions of rage or despair we have when we are wronged.
Yes, the negative consequences may sound kind of daunting. However, there are no worse consequences than making the other person angry. And the real risk is that the attack gets worse and worse, until, eventually, a lot of people like it, or it becomes the popular thing to say. Furthermore, the harm from negative emotions of rage, despair, and so on, not to mention the aversion to insults and negative behaviour, becomes permanent. However, at the same time, you have achieved the goal of getting the good people on the Internet to pay attention.

Back to school – Volunteering and cooking! Don’t let the feeling of the holidays pass you by! Curl your hair, drink lots of water and get some exercise today. All week we’ll keep you posted! Have a great day everyone!
It was a sunny day to attend a WordCamp for writers, bloggers and creative types in Wyoming – but it was the first time a SWISWHITNEYWG event was organized!</s>

Although it is not the basis of this discussion, I do support more education and improved skills for everyone, especially for women. It would be good if the true unemployed people were at least of a decent standard, which is probably far below what many are now. Whilst it is important for individual people to get some employment, it is more important that there are enough jobs available. Certainly some people who enjoy speaking to people about their latest exploits, or viewing 3D action films, would be better off using their talents for skills and occupations for which they have developed a particular interest, rather than the general population, who are unlikely to have the interests and skills needed in the way their employers would prefer.

It would be wonderful if every billionaire who invests in personal development was using his or her money to invest in better education. There are plenty of investments which appear to be perfectly ethical and financially responsible, and thus should not be criticised in the context of this discussion. Those are the investments we make in ourselves as individuals. These investments are vital for everyone who would wish to move forward in life, if only so that it would be a healthier and happier experience.

Travelling has always been one of my lifelong passions. When I started my blog I made the decision to write about how I made the most of a few short trips I have made and have been travelling for the past several years.

Travel is essentially about gathering together positive mental and physical energy for personal growth. With that said, here are some tips that will help you improve the quality of your trips.
When making your budget for a trip, make sure you include expenses that are thought to be unavoidable. This way you can see that your budget is flexible and you won’t have to cancel your trip due to not being able to travel on your budget. Otherwise, it can be devastating if you can’t plan an itinerary due to unforeseen circumstances.
Before you go, purchase your insurance policy. This will insure you if something happens that you wouldn’t be able to cover on your own.
Get into the habit of sharing your experiences on social media. This will let you see what other people have been doing. It is a great way to hear about travel, culture, and a certain place or destination.
If you are planning a road trip, ask if you can stop and shop at your destination. I always start a road trip by stopping at an empty grocery store in town to get supplies before heading out.</s>

@railstones Reply //@Julian... : Until now, you have glorified and used every Islamic occasion/event as an excuse to dismiss from the faith all things that our ancestors tried to preserve in the hopes of blaming the east or maintaining your own version of Islam
To what extent is Jihad and war, the cause of Islam? Anyhow, the article does not bother to explain that Jihad and patience were not without countless examples in the last centuries. And until even the oldest Christians wondered why they were persecuted, this article does not even bother to address that question. As for Allah, we all see what He did not want, such as Hitler and Stalin, hence why He states that He was oppressing everyone. And to go further, Allah was not just oppressing those who lived in the East, He also wanted to be the supreme leader of the world. What does that have to do with Islam? So yes, in the last century, Allah did not refer to the west as our enemy; He desired for the east to also be his. It did not matter if people fought with you or stood in your way, Allah was with you. There were a lot of evil people in the world. They used to come to my hometown every year and demand that we bow down, and the priest sent them to prison; however, they could not catch the priests.

Here’s why you could be suspended from TPTB and sent to a reeducation camp after interacting with a bad guy. Not everyone deserves that, but it’s real.
While it's definitely better to be able to empathize when you can, this one comment of yours would truly send me back 50 years. I do apologize for being so hard on you folks, but we are all that little teens that we are and we have little money and what not. Been on that stage before.. Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
@railstones Reply //@Julian... : Until now, you have glorified and used every Islamic occasion/event as an excuse to dismiss from the faith all things that our ancestors tried to preserve in the hopes of blaming the east or maintaining your own version of Islam
To what extent is Jihad and war, the cause of Islam? Anyhow, the article does not bother to explain that Jihad and patience were not without countless examples in the last centuries. And until even the oldest Christians wondered why they were persecuted, this article does not even bother to address that question. As for Allah, we all see what He did not want, such as Hitler and Stalin, hence why He states that He was oppressing everyone. And to go further, Allah was not just oppressing those who lived in the East, He also wanted to be the supreme leader of the world. What does that have to do with Islam? So yes, in the last century, Allah did not refer to the west as our enemy; He desired for the east to also be his. It did not matter if people fought with you or stood in your way, Allah was with you. There were a lot of evil people in the world. They used to come to my hometown every year and demand that we bow down, and the priest sent them to prison; however, they could not catch the priests. There were also a lot of bad people in the east, and that was where Allah wanted to take them, to the same places where He used to take His people, to the exile. You see, in the eyes of Allah, no one should have to be involved in conflict.

However, while anti-Muslim attitudes seem to be a consequence of immigration policies, this is perhaps not the sole reason for why Austrians view certain Islamophobia as acceptable. According to the Intercultural Ethnicity Attitude Scale (IEXA) by Kaufman et al. (2007) , the reason for what Austrians perceive as acceptable discrimination against Islam in Turkey is that:
Islamophobia seems to be connected to Turkish attitudes toward immigrant Muslims and Muslim minorities (Kaufman et. al., 2007) . Turkish citizens, more than Austrians, believe that immigrant Muslims do not follow the religious teachings of Islam and are hypocrites. Further, Turkish government policies like the cultivation and spread of Islamophobia also contribute to the level of perceived Islamophobia in Turkey.
However, what Islamophobic attitudes are a result of are other factors like the antisemitic attitudes of voters who have resigned their loyalty to Germany and joined the right wing political party and the German media, rather than Islamophobic policies towards Muslims. This leads to the following thesis:
Islamophobia is not only a consequence of the pro-Nazi policies of the Austrian Nazi government, but also of more general antinationalism and anti-Semitism. (This is also supported by Böthe & Bogner [2011] , who found a significant correlation between nativist attitudes and anti-Muslim and antiSemitic attitudes among German Catholics.)
What Is Possible In The Name Of Antisemitism?
Anti-Semitism is a connection between anti-Semitists, anti-Nazi ideology, and anti-Muslem ideology. As argued by Bernhardt (2001) , anti-Muslemism shares some antiSemitism elements with it, for example in the definition of the Jew as a deviant from the culture and religion of the majority. This way anti-Muslem and antiSemite ideology should lead to similar effects on Muslims in Austria. However, with reference to Öhman and Borger (2005) , this could not be confirmed, since there were no correlations between Islamic values, Nationalism, and Anti-Semitism. However, they did find a positive correlation between Anti-Semitic attitudes and the German identification. Thus, Öhman, who is mostly interested in the anti

Contrary to a fair response, most electric vehicles have better fuel efficiency than traditional vehicles such as gasoline vehicles.
I'm uncomfortable with the piece because this leads to questions about the purpose of education and, more broadly, the end of education for some who do not have the ability to succeed in traditional schools. One can think of education as an interdependent set of skills and behaviors that must be learned in order to be able to function in the world we live in. On the other hand, it can also be seen as the unwritten law that is imposed on all who venture into the world. The burden of the education system is on the person who has the means to go to school. I also worry that when we further narrow and separate education into academic disciplines and specialty fields, then people who do not possess a certain skill may lose the chance to learn about and to use those disciplines or specialties. I worry that this narrowing may limit our ability to understand the complex and subtle world we live within.
Quote: The real reason to ignore a crisis is that everyone is afraid to step on it (rationalization).
First, we shouldn't use "everyone" as a general umbrella to include all types of politicians in the USA (of course, not including politicians from the Americas, Europe, and Asia). Second, there have been many crises in the past, and almost none have been completely ignored. In particular, the Great Depression and the Great War were ignored. Third, if there is a crisis to be addressed, then education (as described in the quote) should be addressed.

Third, if there is a crisis to be addressed, then education (as described in the quote) should be addressed.

This is what is wrong with people telling people what to do, it's not at all constructive or helpful. People love to complain, complain all day long but what do they do to help? They complain about others, about things they don't like and it's not right to do that. In a large democracy, it would be hard to think that the average person wouldn't like to live in a democracy but is forced to live in one and cannot think. Now they feel like they have to express their opinion, but they shouldn't act like that, they should act like what they really want is for people to be nice and not complain. If people expect others to help, they have to help themselves. If you ask someone to do something that they don't want to do, then they shouldn't expect others to do it for them.
If they are unable to help themselves then they must begin by trying to understand the situation. It's not really fair to say that you don't like people who have different skin colour, many people do, and sometimes it's in very obvious or obvious ways. It's also not rude or offensive or unpleasant to ask people to comment on stuff if they think it might be helpful. That being said, I think it's very offensive and inappropriate to ask people if they are racist or they're OK with people having different skin colour. This is exactly why most people are opposed to these people migrating to Europe. They want to give a small few more opportunities to all these people to live in the country they grew up and to not worry about the situation there. I think people should vote and everyone should try to help, but these people are stupid

Hollywood actress Rooney Mara has been at the center of a heated debate over the nomination of Jewish director Spike Lee for an Academy Award.
The powerful image of a young black woman and her emancipating story resonated with the audience, but it also challenged elements of the black nationalist narrative, like those currently circulating in the U.S. and Europe, which argue that the term "free" was reserved exclusively for African Americans.
Mara's noble, multi-generational upbringing, along with the hardships that precede and sustain those same factors, rendered her images stronger than any white person ever would have been able to achieve.
She stepped up to the microphone as white people of all ages heard her say with empathy and honesty that she had struggled to carry the weight of blackness for more than 60 years.
"A lot of black people," she said, "have been thinking about this thing called the Afro-American experience and we just really need to think about how many black people have benefited from that."
Although there was an overall positive response to Mara's performance, many white people also chimed in with negative comments.
"In general I think it was a disgraceful performance." says Los Angeles resident Joe Andrews. "I think the Academy is doing its best, but I think if they kept some of the censorship out of the film I think the Academy would do even better."

If I read and follow your directions above, how can we help the user continue to understand and filter the hate messages he receives?
Does this require specific points and hyperlinks, or is it just opening the history (NMT/TC) of each and every comment that appears to contain a hate message and making the user take an action to learn? I ask this for the sole purpose of having the user learn better to handle hate messages, so that he can help himself without anyone interfering. Right now he might get confused on how to handle it, but he can't figure it out unless he practices (because he didn't learn from his first pass). Maybe he's already tired and can't concentrate on taking the better path without interruption.
I think the above is a good start, though I do have one point in the discussion, which was whether it is appropriate to make users be very exact in how they learn from the tutorials. Let's say I load the NMT/TL text/tool and see that it is full of abuse. It's pure hate. I want that training material to be as nontoxic as possible. Is it acceptable for them to learn directly from that material without first correcting themselves (which, if they didn't already, would be much easier)?
You can leave them with the right idea on how to respond (and tell them to delete the original message if they're uncomfortable), but just imagine that they do not own the domain or their IP. When they try to delete the nontoxique thing, there's a right side to it, but also there's a wrong side. Does that bother you?
Is that ok? If you think it's ok, then there is no need to make things so toxic that they can't digest them.

English is your mother tongue - and the method of teaching it is very naive 
I have studied English back in the US because of education. When it came to the point to write in English in exams, I could not do it. Can�t write in English!!! Can�t get to hear my own language spoken at home and listen to American English, and then transcribe it into my own language. What is the difference between writing something you don�t want to understand in your own language, and writing something you do not want to hear in your own tongue? When I was writing my scriptures in English, it felt like I was writing in the foreign language. Reading English today is like reading music notes or a Spanish book. It is no longer an enjoyable process.
hms I, too, believe that education is first and foremost a method of teaching in and out of English. No other language should be used as a substitute for instruction in English; not even Chinese. This is not about providing "immersion" classes or taking children abroad for compulsory schooling. This is about both.
First, at the very least, teaching in and about English (even in Filipino) should not be compulsory. And it is wrong that students who chose to learn another language be confined to the use of that language.
One way to approach the issue, and why it is important, is to keep in mind that real English is as much a cultural heritage, whose impact you cannot deem "immersion." It is part of the Filipino culture that makes the English language different than any other. Filipinos want to become full members of society, and English must serve them well, if not more, than it did in the past. Without our English language, Filipinos would be more likely to be separated from our country, or to lose their cultural identity. We must address the issue of the real English spoken at home as well as the English language used in English classes, and seek to remedy both. More important, we must seek to re-train our students in real English

The following is a message that I am sending to others in a concern about the spread of “disinformation” and anti-immigrant rhetoric in the US, and the effects it has had on real-life communities.
We have been tracking this from a baseline that considers that the word “disinformation,” as we are using it here, refers to the official rhetoric of a leader’s party to appeal to a minority within that same party. Since then we have been observing that the US press is largely ignoring this official word, using the terms “mainstream media” or simply “Media” instead. Or, the main media in one territory is using the word “left,” but from the point of view of its national coverage it’s the word “right” that is being used. We believe this is troubling and we have chosen not to exclude those terms from our baseline because they do help determine the story.
On Friday (June 24th), we received the following email from a large network of LGBT media groups in Los Angeles. Read it in its entirety here. We have since extended the service to organizations in Phoenix and Atlanta as well.
UPDATE: Following the heartbreaking death of George Floyd, racial violence is raging across the U.S. and the rest of our world. While we're all mourning the lost man who became a martyr, we must listen to the cries of our fellow humans whose living is being taken by this race war. Americans should

The following is a message that I am sending to others in a concern about the spread of “disinformation” and anti-immigrant rhetoric in the US, and the effects it has had on real-life communities.
We have been tracking this from a baseline that considers that the word “disinformation,” as we are using it here, refers to the official rhetoric of a leader’s party to appeal to a minority within that same party. Since then we have been observing that the US press is largely ignoring this official word, using the terms “mainstream media” or simply “Media” instead. Or, the main media in one territory is using the word “left,” but from the point of view of its national coverage it’s the word “right” that is being used. We believe this is troubling and we have chosen not to exclude those terms from our baseline because they do help determine the story.
On Friday (June 24th), we received the following email from a large network of LGBT media groups in Los Angeles. Read it in its entirety here. We have since extended the service to organizations in Phoenix and Atlanta as well.
UPDATE: Following the heartbreaking death of George Floyd, racial violence is raging across the U.S. and the rest of our world. While we're all mourning the lost man who became a martyr, we must listen to the cries of our fellow humans whose living is being taken by this race war. Americans should

This country has always lied and deceived but still chose to believe them because its moral high ground just don’t work right now. The Truth is white collar liberals are the villains of our day and they aren’t going to have it any other way. T’ mean black American need to be as loyal to thier families and country as white people and you better believe they’re working towards that right now
lolThis is so hypocritical. Screw the Wall and the Muslim’s’ hunger for Arabs to continue to be built as long as they can control our help.

Even a hateful man would be bold to stand up against your dreams. If you are the light of the world how much more can you hope for other people?
But unless you are willing to ask God to bless you with such a faith, do you not know the devil is behind everything that would happen in the end?
I am sorry, but you have to think of your comments first. I am really upset and this statement is only going to get you and your country and muslim community onto the World Trade Center and that in itself is a bad idea.
Let your high moral standards be for Muslims. Just think for a moment about these girls of the world who are surrendering to islam. These girls have to put on a nice suit and walk into a mansion, and they will be living a life of luxury and their husband and their sons will also have that luxury in their life. They have to run all day with their covers on their heads and know that they are a servant of the man. Now if we are the ones to say that our way is the only way, then we will be responsible for this kind of life. That is just what muslims like to call us a heathen and they hate to hear it, but the truth is that if we do not help these girls make a decision in her life, then they will end up with a heath

There are places and people where people hold opposing views and it really does make life more interesting. I'm all about the variety of opinions that each one has. I, for one, value it.

(2) Each of us tends to assume that others have the answer to the question. Which has been shown to be untrue. We need to accept that our beliefs, personal experiences, and our own minds are not true truths, and that thus are not true to nature at all. We need simply to accept and accept all views with open arms, and ask questions that are understandable to anyone who answers them. Then, based on how we answered the question and even if the answer is incorrect we can still still have something useful to say and show others.
I do understand how hard it is for each of us to tell others how to live, but there should be a place where we all can be friends and not make accusations and judgements based on views and ideologies that we do not agree with. This is something that needs to be dealt with in order for the rest of the thread to be healthy; it does not need to continue to turn into the kind of group talking wars that is sometimes said to be popular on this board.

The complexity of the issue has nothing to do with the “refugees”. Your comment based on false information is unprofessional in every sense.

Your insistence that you support refugees is based on what is your reality, and therefore your perception, not what refugees experience. This is an absolute nonsense. Here is my reality. I am a politically conservative.
It will take more than a political statement to change how the church sees refugee populations. This church does not support the current immigration policies, including which countries will admit refugees. Your piece is based on your own subconscious conclusions regarding refugees based on what you’ve read in a few blog posts that you believe to be representative of your beliefs.
We support the cause of the refugees. We respect and welcome refugees as Christian brothers and sisters, we share with them the Gospel and help them prepare for God’s kingdom.
Please do your research before you comment on the refugee issue. You seem to use personal attacks rather than based on facts. The ad hominem attacks on are generally unfair. Refugee groups provide solid information and methods that can help refugees. Some are more than willing to accommodate refugees. We welcome refugees as God calls us to do. Thank you for following this discussion. : )
Though I always appreciate genuine Christians for their support for refugees, it isn’t their fault that our country’s decision makers acted on this issue. I suppose you will say that the government’s actions on this issue are still unconstitutional and need to be changed. But in my opinion, that’s another debate. The people who own our democracy are going to continue to make mistakes and we should be OK with that. As I see it, it is morally right and fair for them to keep making mistakes, even if it means doing the wrong thing. We cannot judge the government for what it is doing, and we shouldn’t do it.
We should wait until we find out what kind of policy can create a stable and loving society for all. I see a chance for Christians to offer guidance for governments to try to address this issue. God bless

Your piece is based on your own subconscious conclusions regarding refugees based on what you’ve read in a few blog posts that you believe to be representative of your beliefs.
We support the cause of the refugees. We respect and welcome refugees as Christian brothers and sisters, we share with them the Gospel and help them prepare for God’s kingdom.
Please do your research before you comment on the refugee issue. You seem to use personal attacks rather than based on facts. The ad hominem attacks on are generally unfair. Refugee groups provide solid information and methods that can help refugees. Some are more than willing to accommodate refugees. We welcome refugees as God calls us to do. Thank you for following this discussion. : )
Though I always appreciate genuine Christians for their support for refugees, it isn’t their fault that our country’s decision makers acted on this issue. I suppose you will say that the government’s actions on this issue are still unconstitutional and need to be changed. But in my opinion, that’s another debate. The people who own our democracy are going to continue to make mistakes and we should be OK with that. As I see it, it is morally right and fair for them to keep making mistakes, even if it means doing the wrong thing. We cannot judge the government for what it is doing, and we shouldn’t do it.
We should wait until we find out what kind of policy can create a stable and loving society for all. I see a chance for Christians to offer guidance for governments to try to address this issue. God bless

Re-read this section of the discussion and see for yourself why you’re the unprofessional “refugee (creator)”. You don’t have the commitment to understand what the situation is like. The complexity of the issue has nothing to do with the “refugees”. Your comment based on false information is unprofessional in every sense.
Unfortunately, your comment is based on misinformation, and does not reflect your professional attitude toward this issue.
Your insistence that you support refugees is based on what is your reality, and therefore your perception, not what refugees experience. This is an absolute nonsense. Here is my reality. I am a politically conservative.
It will take more than a political statement to change how the church sees refugee populations. This church does not support the current immigration policies, including which countries will admit refugees. Your piece is based on your own subconscious conclusions regarding refugees based on what you’ve read in a few blog posts that you believe to be representative of your beliefs.

Please accept my apologies for using this rather provocative question. In general, to talk about racism in your comments is to open a dialogue and yes, it could be constructive. However, to broaden the conversation without answering my question has prompted a very contentious dialogue, and a negative reaction to my comment.
I am not surprised by your negative reaction to the questions. I should have clarified that what I'm asking is about official population status and is not about religion. In addition, what I was saying to referring to immigrants is that the majority of immigrants that come to this country are not from those countries that are on my list. For example, while immigrants of the Middle East and South Asia arrive in large numbers, the same is not true for the majority of immigration that comes to Australia from Western Europe. So in that case, we're talking about hundreds or thousands of non-Middle Eastern and non-South Asian people who come to Australia.
Like others, I am very interested in how, why, and what are the political and social factors that lead to this situation. Your other replies have helped me a lot, and I'd appreciate it if you would step into a constructive dialogue.
Do you think that if the United States wanted to be considered equal or good friends with Australia, that they would state very explicit that Australia is allowing immigrants from countries that have historically practiced (and continue to practice) racial discrimination?
Don't know why she seems to be linked to Asian people? If you are genuinely concerned about diversity in general, you don't need to link people from any race/ethnic group. I wouldn't go so far as to say they are nasty. It's just not that they aren't empathetic, compassionate

Don't know why she seems to be linked to Asian people? If you are genuinely concerned about diversity in general, you don't need to link people from any race/ethnic group. I wouldn't go so far as to say they are nasty. It's just not that they aren't empathetic, compassionate

Summer homeschool camps are about the family! We like to think of them as your kids’ summer learning and living camp experience.
We start off with some great listening in for the week before we dive into some fun things like soccer, art, Bible study and even some really cool science activity nights! Kids usually leave with 2 or 3 lessons learned to apply the skills they learned in each activity.
We offer Camp and Winter School each summer which are geared towards a specific age group, so feel free to check out the Seasonal Calendar on this site for a more detailed look at what each camp & school day looks like!

Here's a poll of what you're afraid of. They may not be your worst fear, but have you actually asked yourself what it is?�This web-based survey is open to everyone and has three options to pick from—mental health, national security, and religion.
Here you are, my dear citizens. I'm speaking directly to you. If your fears are their most humane use of the Termite Society's time and energy, please stay with us. But in case it's not, if your fears aren't based on knowledge of science and facts, but are in fact your hatred, bigoted chatter, alien-racist rhetoric, radical religiosity, whatever your beliefs are, say nothing. You can continue to watch this show or continue using the Termite hating that makes us all feel in this country today but are only making you more alienated from the nation that you are supposed to be so loyal to. Words matter. And by responding you are affirming the accuracy of our ideas and opinions. As I keep saying, respect does not come from insults but from knowledge. In other words, be respectful.

Now, it seems the house on floor seven is going to be empty.
I wonder how the towering river come from down here.
So we have these towering mountains now.
and we are living in this fair country.
It is sad to me, but our country will be ruined as is just been seen.
It has ruined people, countries and nations, yes.
But it seems today that all the natural laws including the earths natural balance have been reversed.
Things will get worse and worst every day.
Then he shot a petition and petition was distributed to president bush and concluded that native americans can't force u.s citizens to follow certain rules in the immigration law.
It says here, law no. 112 grants legal rights to indian nations.
Now this bill, wrote in the early 1970s, has been an essential cornerstone of america's national defense.
It has enabled americans to march aggressively into foreign lands and occupied them in name of the u.s.
But now, the law on filing alien visas is apparently going to be changed and will force u.S citizens to follow inalienable human rights.
Besides, this bill says that it gives federal and state government the right to deny admission to alien's children born in america to parents who are aliens.
But this bill says, this immigration to the United States is not a privilege, but a right, held in common among all mankind.
Do you know what means "alien"?
Take our country's
capital city Washington, for instance.
The city is a harbor of diversity
and a beacon of light for people who live in foreign countries.
If you have a desire to participate in the public, political, and economic life of the united states, then you are an alien.
But those who didn't want to be harmed, then they are just random people.
Do you now the meaning of "alien", sir?
Well, it means those people who came from foreign countries and are now in America.
We are an american nationality, but not under anyone.
Do you, president bush?
No.
Not by any means.
Now the next page says, they shall not impose any foreign laws or customs in our country.
Now when we start restricting our laws and rights, this will kill the spirit and the soul of american people.

Now, it seems the house on floor seven is going to be empty.
I wonder how the towering river come from down here.
So we have these towering mountains now.
and we are living in this fair country.
It is sad to me, but our country will be ruined as is just been seen.
It has ruined people, countries and nations, yes.
But it seems today that all the natural laws including the earths natural balance have been reversed.
Things will get worse and worst every day.
Then he shot a petition and petition was distributed to president bush and concluded that native americans can't force u.s citizens to follow certain rules in the immigration law.
It says here, law no. 112 grants legal rights to indian nations.
Now this bill, wrote in the early 1970s, has been an essential cornerstone of america's national defense.
It has enabled americans to march aggressively into foreign lands and occupied them in name of the u.s.
But now, the law on filing alien visas is apparently going to be changed and will force u.S citizens to follow inalienable human rights.
Besides, this bill says that it gives federal and state government the right to deny admission to alien's children born in america to parents who are aliens.
But this bill says, this immigration to the United States is not a privilege, but a right, held in common among all mankind.
Do you know what means "alien"?
Take our country's
capital city Washington, for instance.
The city is a harbor of diversity
and a beacon of light for people who live in foreign countries.
If you have a desire to participate in the public, political, and economic life of the united states, then you are an alien.
But those who didn't want to be harmed, then they are just random people.
Do you now the meaning of "alien", sir?
Well, it means those people who came from foreign countries and are now in America.
We are an american nationality, but not under anyone.
Do you, president bush?
No.
Not by any means.
Now the next page says, they shall not impose any foreign laws or customs in our country.
Now when we start restricting our laws and rights, this will kill the spirit and the soul of american people.
Most americans are not the ones who think this, they are just lazy.
They want to live a normal life, they want

Do you have any proof that Sweeden crime rate increased because of immigration? or that UK is spending too much resources on them? Or that France is cracking down on immigration? I think it's just xenophobic lies

the definition of stupidity is doing the same thing over and over again, expecting a different result. That’s how stupid dumb is. We need real world consequences for the stupid behavior we take.
what do you think of America’s democratic system. Why are we not making great leaders, our society is so corrupt, and we are not going to change anything. If you know something about the man, open your mouth!
as for “this is my country, not yours.” You have a point. They’ve already voted. They’re literally voting.
Go ahead, tell America, with all their protest, why it shouldn’t fund the government of the moon. It’ll tell them.
Wow, a bunch of homies here. Who knows what to say.
America, be nice, go suck some poisonous goat for awhile, just to make sure there’s not an outbreak.
Do you know how much better health we can have just by eating a lot of goat meat? Do you know what poor people are like in India, Myanmar and China if they don’t have healthy goat? These countries are under a government-sanctioned famine, which means that no one has the mental capacity to think about poaching!
We don’t want poisonous goats, we want rich people to clean up their behaviour.
How about they take money from their own citizens first and let foreign poachers go kill goats for cheap?!?!

You have used no less than 11 (n. 11) different signatures for your petition, Mr. Chief, and I feel that is not a good strategy. Regardless, I am shocked that your long blond hair falls such a bit to your chest that it may be a bit confused as to who you are. On behalf of the LGBT community in Chicago I have therefore come to your aid and we will now introduce you to Mr. Basil Strauss. Lord Strauss. Glad to meet you Mr. Strauss. Thank you so much for your hard work to guide the LGBT community. Goodbye Mr. Basham; by the way, your new role at UDN is to help turn hateful speech into less hateful speech. He stands with the good and the bad. Hate is not tolerated at UDN.

Members of the LGBT group have the right to be free from discrimination. Now, therefore, I am making an offer to him to withdraw the complaint. The whole of Chicago is made up of our LGBT friends, and we ask that you withdraw your complaint. However, I think you would make a nice publicity stunt if you formally returned the complaint to the LGBT community to be sent to your friends in Chicago for further consideration, but I think it would be better if you withdrew it. Please note the Western Standard has spoken, and I will thank you for your service to the LGBT group in Chicago. First I wanted to compliment you on your ability to convince my cousin to fight to repeal the SOPA, even though it is an industry she worked for for over 13 years, as well as opposition to the Death Penalty (approved by American Representatives and now the White House).

Regardless, I am shocked that your long blond hair falls such a bit to your chest that it may be a bit confused as to who you are.

Thank you so much for your hard work to guide the LGBT community. Goodbye Mr. Basham; by the way, your new role at UDN is to help turn hateful speech into less hateful speech. He stands with the good and the bad. Hate is not tolerated at UDN.

If you’re on Facebook and if you notice that people comment with non-hateful comments, we are, like this fake Canadian video, also going to look at Facebook. It’s not. In fact, we found that people on Facebook haven’t done anything more nefarious than swear that Iraq’s genocide may never have happened.
There’s nothing wrong with non-hate comments—it’s okay to exchange negative views. It’s also okay to to disagree—what’s wrong with that? If someone’s expressing a legitimate concern or debate, it’s okay. If that debate or concern turns ugly, it’s perfectly fine not to respond that way.
Social media has become the go-to mechanism for spreading hate. One day soon, the president of Facebook might not even be allowed to step outside of his personal bubble. Facebook policy requires that you participate, like, comment on, share, and share. The more you do, the more your interactions will be tracked. You may not know what your friends think, or how they believe, or where they live, or who they are, or where you live, or when they celebrate their birthday, or whether or not you are depressed or suicidal, or what they paid taxes on. Yes, Facebook is very detailed about how it collects, stores, and uses your personal information. But the key to understanding is that you have no control over how much personal information Facebook can collect from you, and you certainly don’t know who you’re really friends with. You have few choices beyond consent, no privacy controls, and absolutely no rights.
This has had clear consequences for the people of Calais. The likes of David Coleman, who reported the case of two Muslims who hid in a trunk in his car and were abducted by the Turkish police to be forced onto a lorry, were allegedly cyber bullied after posting a statement on Facebook that was meant to be controversial and called their attacks “racist and sexist” and that the “emotions are at a high.” Further, Facebook removed hundreds of comments about the same case, who couldn’t find, or didn’t remember, to undo them.

If the poster is abusive or malicious, flag the comment itself; if the comment is well-formed and useful, flag the original question/answer.
When the comment is removed, make sure you leave a comment with a link to the question, including details of the deletion. In particular, you should mention that the question/answer was removed:

"To clarify: Was the question off-topic, off-quality, or offensive?"

In addition, you should also comment on whether the deletion was intentional (but not swear words), whether you thought that it would have been removed by the community (if not, please tell why you believe that it should have been removed), and whether you would like to see the question re-opened.

Sadly, our number one priority during the crisis has been keeping our colleagues and their families safe in Lebanon
Denial or gross misrepresentation of that work will have the effect of placing them in danger. The violence that they are suffering cannot be undone. It will take months and even years to get back to their normal lives.
There is no safe zone for the human beings trying to return home. In light of this, UNHCR is not returning our colleagues home.
We know what this means. We have witnessed traumatic events that have become permanent, even after the end of the conflict.
It's understandable that people want to return to their homeland, but this can only happen as part of a long and complex process.
It would be surprising if returning here would return their people home. It would be surprising to not have any real consequences for anyone involved. This should be enough for you to keep the police away.
We understand that they brought in an international team that was purposefully sent here to address the legitimate concerns of our staff. Even if they had used the targeted words, they would have agreed that the issues that those staff raised were legitimate concerns and were relevant. And they would have been legitimate concerns of a UN team that has visited their country in the past.
I would also caution people to be careful in how they respond to the hate messages and be respectful of those in power who will have to take up these serious messages and talk about it. It is important for everyone to be able to do that. Not just as journalists but as human beings.
At the time, how can we think it is our job to keep our colleagues safe? And in a general sense, how is our responsibility to our colleagues to keep them safe? So what is this having to do with the PI:USER? Does it help to know that we are going to leave if they make sure that they hurt people and would think it just as sensible for them to leave

Alternatively, 1 could be a concern of a professional who is performing a business talk at the expense of a President, to use their home town, with no outing but to light a candle and stop to share a meal.
This question is for code reuse, you have very limited potential improvements here, which is why I raised the extra and vague constraints of specifically avoiding formalism, plagiarism, and phrasing.

A:

My first two cents:
I'm amazed no-one said anything about using specialized language. This is a category at least as important as plain English.
As for the first part of the question - I would assume that the person who posted the question did not come up with any hate messages themselves, but then I wouldn't have thought it was relevant to what the website was looking for in the first place. So I'm wondering how such a website can even be of any help to any real person if people do not know to use a special type of language to describe these kinds of situations.
From my point of view, I believe people are very good at general language when talking to strangers, and they have nothing to lose if they cannot perfect it when talking to their friends. But if the company that decides whether they will use or not actually does something good for the community, then they can be perfectly happy to choose another, more specialized, website.
It's not a full-blown hate language that is being presented here, but it's easily recognized by the fact that it's not generally accepted. I would say that people could have used sentences like 

I've never disliked Trump before.

and that those people wouldn't have been passed over for the website they were looking for.

A:

I've spent some time looking into this and have come up with this ugly token evaluation script. It uses GenericRegex for matching more than a string of them, and RStudio TokenExpander for tokenizing the language into nicer grammars. I haven't got it used as a performant tool, but I think it helps a lot in terms of brevity. 
I've added the line

1, 2, 3, 4. NOTE: use suitable punctuation.
Some of the language could be spelt out if needed, however, the intent of the hate messages is already known and you can use existing information as you go.
For example, 1 might be a very serious hypothetical reference to President Obama threatening to cancel a public speaking event if it gets publicly known the cost to the public. Alternatively, 1 could be a concern of a professional who is performing a business talk at the expense of a President, to use their home town, with no outing but to light a candle and stop to share a meal.
This question is for code reuse, you have very limited potential improvements here, which is why I raised the extra and vague constraints of specifically avoiding formalism, plagiarism, and phrasing.

A:

My first two cents:
I'm amazed no-one said anything about using specialized language. This is a category at least as important as plain English.
As for the first part of the question - I would assume that the person who posted the question did not come up with any hate messages themselves, but then I wouldn't have thought it was relevant to what the website was looking for in the first place. So I'm wondering how such a website can even be of any help to any real person if people do not know to use a special type of language to describe these kinds of situations.
From my point of view, I believe people are very good at general language when talking to strangers, and they have nothing to lose if they cannot perfect it when talking to their friends. But if the company that decides whether they will use or not actually does something good for the community, then they can be perfectly happy to choose another, more specialized, website.

I am currently struggling with binge eating and weight loss. (of roughly 8kg). I have tried a number of websites and resources to help me keep myself going on the “walk & talk” approach to Weight Loss. I have been using the sites below to help me on my way:  https://act-thriven.com/ https://www.bellyaching.net/ → Have been struggling to find real & relevant information for my age, I have seen people ages 45+ constantly moving! You try so hard and reach a point of turning into a stone wall. All I can say is shame on you!! Have you tried bingeing? How long was the longest you did this in? 15,30 or 45 minutes? Be real. Try to push yourself to at least 10 minutes. Use the websites above to get information on your area and find sites that offer you more knowledge like; can anyone suggest the best way to lose weight that is not simply cutting down your calories? Examples would be food sensitivities, gut dysbiosis and fructose intolerance.
Thanks in advance.

A:

You may be better off taking a look at binge eating disorder. As far as medically treating it, your gut bacteria may not have the right balance of good and bad bacteria in it, and that might be contributing to your weight problems.
There are a lot of reasons you may be struggling to lose weight. There are lots of medication that can help you deal with your body's signals. There are many nutrition companies that claim to help people lose weight. Some also make diets that are more work than most people are willing to put in. Some people with a binge eating problem are even best off just taking certain medications, such as Ritalin, and other prescription medications and supplements that they may take to help them eat more slowly and so they'll feel less hungry.</s>

@OP9 people with equal rights shouldn't be target of politics.You can have your views and free speech but try do not invade the domains of other's.You are siding with those against whom you have no repute.When they are asked about their motives of hate you answer simply: "they don’t even deserve it..." .It is a sin to attack someone you don’ t like and to never acknowledge the fact that they have enough chances to improve.
Hey this debate is about hate speech. What kind of rules did you set up for all who were involved in the debate?

@OP9 people with equal rights shouldn't be target of politics.You can have your views and free speech but try do not invade the domains of other's.You are siding with those against whom you have no repute.When they are asked about their motives of hate you answer simply: "they don’t even deserve it..." .It is a sin to attack someone you don’ t like and to never acknowledge the fact that they have enough chances to improve.
Hey this debate is about hate speech. What kind of rules did you set up for all who were involved in the debate?
@Major spon:you can not touch me though you have to imagine yourself like that ... Best thing of god is it became painful for them to correct me.

India’s one and only nation which values all communities and religions, yet they also call themselves a beautiful nation!
India can be a country like Pakistan or Afghanistan.
But India still remains great
I salute all the authors of these videos who criticize other countries because of their oppressions and say they are also suffering from it! Hinduism is the religion of love but not hatred and rape but rather love of life, love of humanity. Everyone believes in God. We have the right to speak our mind and ideas.
To be sincere , we are not totally against that, but India must value the ones who have no money and other benefits because no one is perfect and especially under a Muslim regime.
If only our government takes this decision rightly and don’t focus on finance only. Our democracy will be long-lasting and strong. I believe Muslims have certain rights to practise their religion so they must take good care of our values. I feel it is fair for all our families to speak their mind.</s>

El primer discurso con el que acabó Rajoy y del que se ha hecho eco 'El País' fue el del primer secretario del PSOE, Pedro Sánchez, que se refirió a los malos tratos como "malos, y brutales", que "exigen mucho más que un sevicio público". "Sólo una justicia distinta puede proporcionarnos a todos y todas, en el siglo XXI, una respuesta firme y contundente contra los malos tratos y todas sus formas", aseveró.
En ese discurso, el secretario general del PSOE recordó que el Código Penal de 1985 tipificó como "delitos leves" (hasta una pena de 6 meses), como los empujones, los empujones a la puerta o los daños que "ningún delito son pues, los maltrato psicológico. Es decir, un hombre maltratador sufre los mismos efectos de violencia física". "Por eso, el gobierno del PP no puede pretender que los maltratadores no merezcan el castigo que merecen porque quieren acallar la opinión pública y que no vayan a presentarse a elecciones el próximo año", zanjó.
Desde el Gobierno, la ministra de Sanidad, Consumo y Bienestar Social, María Luisa Carcedo, también se manifestó a favor del indulto y defendió que esta es la única manera de dar la necesaria "credibilidad" a las políticas de lucha contra la violencia machista. "Creo que es lo que haría cualquiera que defendiera este acuerdo y que puede estar en la agenda de los distintos partidos políticos", dijo Carcedo.

MEXICO CITY, 26 Sep 2019 / 12:37 am (CNA/EZMB).- Mexico's President Andrés Manuel López Obrador declared an emergency on Saturday amid an outbreak of COVID-19 among migrant and asylum seekers arriving at Mexico's southern border.
"As a responsible government, we must adopt measures that ensure the protection of the health of our citizens at risk," López Obrador said in a press conference. "We must act at the same time that we close the border and respect the commitments entered into with our American brothers and sisters, without allowing inhumane practices of any sort.”
Washington, Oct 7 (EFE).- The coronavirus outbreak prompted the decision to suspend the migrant caravans crossing into the US in preparation for a planned open border later this year, President Donald Trump said on Thursday.
"We ended up with a very, very, very ugly situation," Trump said during a one-on-one phone conversation with Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.
"What had been a massive and well-organized human trafficking came to an abrupt halt."
"We can get the border open next year," Trump assured Lopez Obrador. The leader of Mexico's conservative faction at the federal legislative assembly said they supported a limit to the number of migrants who are allowed to enter the country this year.
"We'll give him a real solution, so that he doesn't have to have (the immigration detention) camps," the president said.
Under a recent agreement with his Mexican counterpart, Trump set the border open on June 20 to help stranded migrants from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador as they seek to enter the United States. But he also arranged for migrants from other countries to enter through his southern border, under lockdown. López Obrador has resisted that plan.
The Trump administration said the discussions last week were the first since President Joe Biden came to office in the United States on Wednesday.

#Syrian_Refugees are IN HAND LESSMOVER. Adding upon those signs of handless aggression and eyes to see others who do not carry the color of the WHITE people by birth. These persons have come under a financial, psychological and physical stress.
There are videos on YouTube, watching the aggressors, murderers, rioters and civil disturbers.
A video from the daily Mail magazine, filmed by Chris Gidney, of immigrants rushing into the centre of Jerusalem with barrels and fire arms under the commanding and able leadership of a Syrian refugees called Talal. He was the only leader they could trust because he spoke English and they knew the pressure he was facing.
The women and children were starving. Half of them had been denied food for five days.
They were bought places and then sold to a company called Qumra, for $1,400 per head. That’s less than £1 per day!
The German government (Interior Minister Peter Altmaier) condemned the behaviour of these "refugees."
He said: “In everyday life the Syrian refugees experience attacks on their economic or religious rights, and our State is in complete agreement with the public that they should not be subjected to such attacks."
The Syrian refugee registration program in Germany was halted on August 25 by Germany’s Minister for Social Affairs and Family.
The program was in place for the next 18 months. After its completion, the offices of the German Federal Department for Refugees and Migration will still be open, but the refugee registration process will no longer be taking place there.

A video from the daily Mail magazine, filmed by Chris Gidney, of immigrants rushing into the centre of Jerusalem with barrels and fire arms under the commanding and able leadership of a Syrian refugees called Talal. He was the only leader they could trust because he spoke English and they knew the pressure he was facing.
The women and children were starving. Half of them had been denied food for five days.
They were bought places and then sold to a company called Qumra, for $1,400 per head. That’s less than £1 per day!
The German government (Interior Minister Peter Altmaier) condemned the behaviour of these "refugees."
He said: “In everyday life the Syrian refugees experience attacks on their economic or religious rights, and our State is in complete agreement with the public that they should not be subjected to such attacks."
The Syrian refugee registration program in Germany was halted on August 25 by Germany’s Minister for Social Affairs and Family.
The program was in place for the next 18 months. After its completion, the offices of the German Federal Department for Refugees and Migration will still be open, but the refugee registration process will no longer be taking place there.

Unfortunately, lots of supporters of the controversial British Vote Leave campaign are getting a 'hate-phobic' badge when a comment goes down that does not instantly contradict their anti-Brexit propaganda. The problem is that they have been recommending the hashtag (#hateph) to all of their supporters since the campaign's launch, so now they get a 'hateph' badge at each comment they make.
Despite the following examples being difficult to read, it's very clear that the hated proponents of the campaign are using the hashtag as part of their anti-Brexite propaganda to encourage their hated opponents to use it as well:
(a) The original word for #br230475904 is a mix of terms that makes no sense. The first number (523,756) refers to a Tory tougher stance, the second number (12,785) is more Tory-like (which can be either better or worse), but the third number is either `#hatef01` or `#habeast` (which can mean anything about the Tory Party or its politicians). The third number was obviously a misspelling for 'Hate Mayor' (in English), and there is no translation. If you don't know the Tory (and usually Brexiteer) term, you can use that (or 'It's legal!'), but if you know that term, you can't get a response. – Gabriel Bruno on November 5 at 8:40 PM
Their badges will now not instantly remove the 'hatephobic' stigma, so those same people will keep saying what they are told by the hated organisers, even if they don't match with the hated propaganda they are telling people they are supposed to listen to. This will stop them from playing a constructive role in the campaign. – Rafael Hartmann on November 5 @ 8:41 PM
Notice that the organiser is said to have misused the hashtag. The posting actually asks for suggestions for improving the new hashtag

someone is likely going to like this 'featured message' which is posted by the user as an answer.
Users will be notified through the system, and if they do not immediately revert, the answer will be deleted.
This doesn’t mean that this will be enforced. Those who follow the minimum requirements will be approved, the others won’t be.
Applicants from minority groups usually do well, so you should think carefully if you want to apply for citizenship and then if you don’t like that review.
The main disadvantage of the system is that you can’t see reviews from citizens before applying for citizenship.
This is a bit of a set-up problem, because you need a minimum quantity of reviews to apply for the process. Citizens do not make significant contributions on the main site, so there are probably thousands of people who can provide reviews who will never get to see them. And getting to see others’ reviews is so easy – almost anybody can sign up.
3) There is no unique character that differentiates Westerners from Easterners so there’s no discrimination.
4) Westerners’ demeanour or behaviour to others have nothing to do with their culture or their country of origin. They are just slightly more polite and courteous than East Asians.
In the latter case, you do not apply for citizenship automatically. You need to appear at the citizenship review process.
so maybe i want to be there this is my faults. so what your reasoning behind how you are playing this
Seriously, someone needs to come up with a way to make a negative aspect of the country disappear on the basis of a person’s race. Obvious examples come to mind: a country banned from people dressed as steampunk heroes if wearing the costumes constitutes incitement of violence against the police.
People do not have to be politically correct to feel morally entitled to be treated without prejudice.
It is not the value of cultural heritage, traditions, or religion that is under scrutiny, but how to use them in the world.</s>

someone is likely going to like this 'featured message' which is posted by the user as an answer.
Users will be notified through the system, and if they do not immediately revert, the answer will be deleted.
This doesn’t mean that this will be enforced. Those who follow the minimum requirements will be approved, the others won’t be.
Applicants from minority groups usually do well, so you should think carefully if you want to apply for citizenship and then if you don’t like that review.
The main disadvantage of the system is that you can’t see reviews from citizens before applying for citizenship.
This is a bit of a set-up problem, because you need a minimum quantity of reviews to apply for the process. Citizens do not make significant contributions on the main site, so there are probably thousands of people who can provide reviews who will never get to see them. And getting to see others’ reviews is so easy – almost anybody can sign up.
3) There is no unique character that differentiates Westerners from Easterners so there’s no discrimination.
4) Westerners’ demeanour or behaviour to others have nothing to do with their culture or their country of origin. They are just slightly more polite and courteous than East Asians.
In the latter case, you do not apply for citizenship automatically. You need to appear at the citizenship review process.

Dear @user, don't block PI:USER for using language that the home school would ban, such as 'black' and 'gay'. Those school textbooks have been vetted over the years by both Hate Incident Task Forces and the black community. They are remarkably free of the language of racism.
So this is what MSM reads as a white-on-white situation. Yet, if the "whole world" is racist, then Obama's doing nothing wrong. You'd think he would have noticed that news organizations needed to act more to help those other than whites. Meanwhile, we have this little "ethnic" riot on our hands. Shit!
I guess the bigger picture is that because I am not African-American, I was not a statistic to be counted by the country. So I am not a statistic and so I don't count. So this group is under attack and I'm a statistic.
if what was actually happening were white on white intolerance it would be something different, where the white religious types would only have to deal with all of the "hate" incidents with which they have been burdened over the years, but for some reason, they get the "whites are a racist" excuse. I want to bet that the entire white population would be excited if this showed up in election ballots as one of the candidates was going to claim that they were being blacklisted as a potential candidate.
I don't know what people with non-African-American ancestry feel like about being treated as a group with which to segregate. And yet, I do know that I cannot look in the mirror and not see an Afro-American woman who is unfairly treated. So what does that have to do with whites? I understand that a certain group of whites does not want to be blacklisted as potential candidates for elections.

anyone know how to get VAT stamp on the bottom of a charge card? I don't believe the "flash" numbers on the back of my card are stamped on it
@johnbeer
does anyone have an article that talks about setting the net retail price lower and causing customers to buy more at lower prices?
The more the merchants try to exploit the current situation. I don't see why, they have so much to lose. I suspect everyone has cut back on profits, and the government will not do anything to help. Suggestion that Congress lower taxes on income, I get it. Every tax cut makes the rich richer, even if it means harder to pay off mortgages.

A:

This needs to be done quickly.  The faster you do this, the more opportunity you have for success (assuming it becomes legal and is available to merchants with an existing online business).  Lowering VAT allows merchants to charge lower prices and is done by many other countries all over the world.
It may not be easy to do it all in one day, but it's better than waiting for the government to do it.  
The problem is that the government has vastly overregulated online businesses that require certification before they can operate.  The only opportunity you have is if the merchants get it done before they get stamped with their taxes.
You can tell it to the committee that represents your state in the Senate.  If that doesn't work, you have to take this to Congress in the House.  This will most likely have to be negotiated.  It needs to be short on words, but made as clear as possible.
Senate Bill 929 is a perfectly sound idea.  It could be reversed with a simple amendment to the tax code.  
I can guarantee you that will give you a significant amount of time

How would you answer that?

“it has been studied that kids born to non-citizens are more likely to smoke because they are subjected to a high risk of environmental toxins”

Well yes. But you haven’t researched this very carefully or put the word “talked” back in.

“”Pre-school children from immigrant backgrounds are at greater risk for childhood obesity than their non-immigrant peers.”

Yeah, that you know about, but you don’t. This study was about obesity, and while they found a connection between immigrant background and obesity, the probability that your premise is correct is well below 1%. So this is the same kind of data that would be featured in the most recent CDC report.
“As the study shows, interventions aimed at preventing lung function decline have similar efficacy in all children – even immigrant children. This is the largest population of non-Hispanic blacks ever studied in a primary care setting.”

Nope. I can remember reading something that said if you do not have a BMI reading that indicates overweight or obesity, then that is no indication that you are obese. And here’s the reason: You can be nearly obese, and have a normal BMI reading. So yes, there is a correlation, but the true burden of obesity and overweight cannot be measured with a BMI alone.
The examples you give about environmental toxins and childhood obesity are hard to evaluate since there hasn’t been a study done looking at differences in those children born into immigrant families, and those born into same-race families. So, you have to be honest, the association is very, very weak, and often statistically insignificant. You could have included the word “tested” in your sentence though, since most of
