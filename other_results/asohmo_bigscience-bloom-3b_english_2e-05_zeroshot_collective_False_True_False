@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s | Collective: illegals  -  illegals | Property: game the hashtag immigration
Being humanitarian in interpreting the law is not the same as allowing someone to game the immigration system. Who cares if someone takes a little while to complete their paperwork...everyone does it.

I think it is good that we have people from all over the world come to our country to help us grow and prosper. I also think that it is good for our country to have people who come from other countries because they bring with them their own culture, their own traditions, and their own way of life. I think that we can learn a lot from other cultures, and I think that it would be a good thing for our country if more people from other cultures came to our country.</s>
