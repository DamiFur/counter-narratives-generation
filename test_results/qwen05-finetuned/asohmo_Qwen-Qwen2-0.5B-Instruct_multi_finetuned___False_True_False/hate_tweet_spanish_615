@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
If they are deporting them because they broke the law then they are not gameing the system. If they are claiming asylum because they are fleeing war then they are claiming it not because they are a criminal. Both situations are the same though, so there is no reason to stop them from doing what they did.
