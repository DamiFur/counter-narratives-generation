regardless of intent the term " undocumented immigrant " is incorrect because illegal aliens are foreigners (i e aliens ) who are unlawfully present in the united states (i e illegal) https://t co/aarjtduwya https://t co/hkrv7mpzok
I don't understand why "illegals" are considered "formers" and "citizens" are not. All the contrary, illegal immigrants are "rules" and "laws" are "broken" when they are "illegal".
