@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
Real refugees don't act like a "taxi" and don't come to seek welfare. They are desperate people looking for a better future
