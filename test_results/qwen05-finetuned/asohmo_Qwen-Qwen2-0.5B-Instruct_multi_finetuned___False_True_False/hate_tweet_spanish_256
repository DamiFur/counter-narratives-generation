about 3700 refugee medicine doctors are allowed to work in germany in hospitals now they realize that some of them are not on the standard of western medicine and often some buyed the certificats home without knowledge so some patients died https://t co/belfz7m72z
How do you know that some refugees are not trained doctors? That seems just like a xenophobic hypothesis not backed up by any evidence
