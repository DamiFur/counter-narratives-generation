@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
Of course they are economic migrants, there is no choice. But you are talking about people, and people want welfare, especially when they are in desperate situations
