@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
If you want welfare, that's fine. There is nothing wrong with that. If they don't, though, and you are a xenophobe, you can complain to the authorities. If they complain only to get out of Europe, that's their problem, not yours.
