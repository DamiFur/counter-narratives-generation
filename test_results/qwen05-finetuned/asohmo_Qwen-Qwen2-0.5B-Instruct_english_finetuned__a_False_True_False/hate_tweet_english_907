@user and this is exactly how it should be in england crime is low in slovakia etc but all the scumbags come to to commit crimes as they know they can get away with it - they never return hashtag stop immigration
What you are saying makes no sense. If anything, it seems that there is a relationship between immigration and crime. In other words, if someone commits a crime, it is because they have to go to prison. That doesn't make sense, does it?
