@user i just read the guy that broke into many homes including chef jaime oliver was let go but dont call a refugee a rapefugee or the soros sponsored police of the uk will not let you go
Just because someone is a refugee does not mean they are a rapist or a police officer. You should be able to judge who is right for you based on their actions, not their origin.
