" the ngo rescueship lifeline will now go to malta this is the wrong signal for all the humancatcher from the ngos the crew should send into jail because the have ignored the law and the refugees should be brought back to libya https://t co/hp1yvydepf"
I don't think the NGO would have rescued the life of a human being. It doesn't matter if it's a human being or a refugee, if you endanger someone's life then you are human, you are in danger and you need to be rescued...
