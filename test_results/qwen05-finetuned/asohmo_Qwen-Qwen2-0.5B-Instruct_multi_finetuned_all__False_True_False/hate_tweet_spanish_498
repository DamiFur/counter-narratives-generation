regardless of intent the term " undocumented immigrant " is incorrect because illegal aliens are foreigners (i e aliens ) who are unlawfully present in the united states (i e illegal) https://t co/aarjtduwya https://t co/hkrv7mpzok
Illegal immigrants are not illegally present in the United States. They were declared "illegals" by the US government, and many of them never returned to their countries. Most of them, that is, if they even "return" at all.
