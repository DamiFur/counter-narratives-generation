@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
No one is asking you, or the rest of us immigrants is "our country". It is a country, essentially a place, and people have the right to it, as do immigrants.
