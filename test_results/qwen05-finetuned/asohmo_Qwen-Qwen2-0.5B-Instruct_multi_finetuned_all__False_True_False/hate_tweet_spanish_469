meanwhile in europe nobody speaks the truth that all of the potential millions of migrants and refugees can not be taken into the euro zone former colonial powers like france &amp britain are not without guilt in the creation of the mess that is most of the african continent today
It is not true that the presence of a single colonial power in the continent has anything to do with the presence of refugees and migrants. Refugees and migrants are everywhere, in every country, and that is what matters most
