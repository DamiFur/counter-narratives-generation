drunken refugees - is that sad or a nature law no refugee have to leave his country to have a better life this means he can also get dead on his journey for hope and so its better to stay home than to dream https://t co/hzyiafrp9m
It is not true that refugees have to leave their country in order to have a "better life". Refugees have the right to seek a better life, and it is not to be "dreamed away" but to "belonged to". Stop manipulating reality
