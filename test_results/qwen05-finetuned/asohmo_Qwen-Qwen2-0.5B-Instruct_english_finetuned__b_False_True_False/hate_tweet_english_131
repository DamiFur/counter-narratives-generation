@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
It is not true that they are all economic migrants/ invadiers. There are many refugees, and most of them are not economic migrants/ invaders.
