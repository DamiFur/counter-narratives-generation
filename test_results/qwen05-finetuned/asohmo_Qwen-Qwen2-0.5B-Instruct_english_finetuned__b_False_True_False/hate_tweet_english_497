@user i just read the guy that broke into many homes including chef jaime oliver was let go but dont call a refugee a rapefugee or the soros sponsored police of the uk will not let you go
Not all refugees are rapists. Not all rapists are refugees. In fact, most refugees are not rapists, and the more you think that way, the more you are going to think like a xenophobe.
