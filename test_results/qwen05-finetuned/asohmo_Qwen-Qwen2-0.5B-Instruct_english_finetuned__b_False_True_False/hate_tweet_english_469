meanwhile in europe nobody speaks the truth that all of the potential millions of migrants and refugees can not be taken into the euro zone former colonial powers like france &amp britain are not without guilt in the creation of the mess that is most of the african continent today
What do you mean by taking refugees into the EU? to get free education and support from the state? that sounds like a scam to me
