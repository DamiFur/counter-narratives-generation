" the ngo rescueship lifeline will now go to malta this is the wrong signal for all the humancatcher from the ngos the crew should send into jail because the have ignored the law and the refugees should be brought back to libya https://t co/hp1yvydepf"
I don't think the NGO would send people to Malta. They work only for the good of the refugees, who are almost entirely made up of immigrants.
