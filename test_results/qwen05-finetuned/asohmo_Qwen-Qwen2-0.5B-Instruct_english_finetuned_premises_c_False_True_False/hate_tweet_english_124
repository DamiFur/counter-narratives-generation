@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
I don't understand the meaning of your phrase. What is "right" and why should what you say be considered "country"? No country gives rights to immigrants.
