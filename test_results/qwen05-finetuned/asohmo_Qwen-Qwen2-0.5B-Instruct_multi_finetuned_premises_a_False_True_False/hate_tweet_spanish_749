problem for the pm re johnson is that a person who sent round vans telling immigrants to go home is not in a position to lecture anyone on racism the lesson of which is: if you pander theyll take everything you give them and keep pushing for more
If you pander, well, you know you're going to get something, don't you? If you don't get what you want, you push for more, you know what I mean.
