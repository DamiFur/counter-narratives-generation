@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
No, they are not the same thing. A country is a place to live, to work and to be a citizen. If you do not like the country in which you live, it does not mean that you do not have a right to enter it, nor that it is not a good country...
