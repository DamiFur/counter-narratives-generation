@user time to start firing judges who dont detain immigrants so @user can deport if he was detain and not given a bond that citizen would be alive
If the citizen is innocent until proven guilty, then the judge should not have any say over who is released and who is not. It is a matter of national security, not a matter of choice of the citizen.
