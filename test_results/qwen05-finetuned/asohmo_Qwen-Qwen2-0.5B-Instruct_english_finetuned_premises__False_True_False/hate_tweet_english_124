@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
"Dogs in America" or "Dogs in Mexico" and "our country" have nothing to do with it. You're just showing your prejudice
