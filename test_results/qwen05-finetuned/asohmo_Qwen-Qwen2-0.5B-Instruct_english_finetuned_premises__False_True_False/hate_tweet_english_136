for all the people holding up signs regarding illegal immigrants hand them each a bill to pay the cost of how much these people take from the american taxpayer and i bet they would take down their signs and go home
I don't take it personally, but they are not taking anything out of the American taxpayer's. They are simply showing their support for our country.
