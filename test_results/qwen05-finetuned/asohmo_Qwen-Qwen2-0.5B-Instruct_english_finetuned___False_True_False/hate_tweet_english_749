problem for the pm re johnson is that a person who sent round vans telling immigrants to go home is not in a position to lecture anyone on racism the lesson of which is: if you pander theyll take everything you give them and keep pushing for more
What you are saying makes no sense. If you give something to someone else, they should be able to take it too. If you want to go home, that's your problem, not yours.
