@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
What you are saying makes no sense. If they are fleeing war, they are usually desperate and looking for a better place to live. A taxi service, on the other hand, is full of people looking for a place to work and to have a decent life.
