@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
Because there are less illegal immigrants that want to claim asylum than there are legal ones. You can't say that this group of people are all bad and the rest are good.
