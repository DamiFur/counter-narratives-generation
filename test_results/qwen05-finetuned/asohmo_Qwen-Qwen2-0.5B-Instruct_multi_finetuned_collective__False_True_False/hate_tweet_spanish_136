for all the people holding up signs regarding illegal immigrants hand them each a bill to pay the cost of how much these people take from the american taxpayer and i bet they would take down their signs and go home
If someone is a bill payer then that person has to pay the bills but not the other way around. If you want to discuss how to reduce taxes then you can discuss that instead of trying to get other people to agree with you
