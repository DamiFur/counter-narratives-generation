@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
Assuming that is true, why not allow them to claim asylum early? If the problem is that they did something wrong, it doesn't have to be solved by sending them back to the place they committed the crime.
