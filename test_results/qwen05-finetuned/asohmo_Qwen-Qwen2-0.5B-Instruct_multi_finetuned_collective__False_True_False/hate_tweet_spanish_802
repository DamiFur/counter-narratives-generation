@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
If they were refugees, they would not pose as refugees. They are refugees because you want them to be refugees
