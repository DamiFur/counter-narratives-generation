eu is a big spender of taxmoney turkey gets again many â‚¬ for keeping the refugees away from europe of course also other countries in africa want now money from the eu like libya sudan aso the only help would be now concentrationcamps hopefully without food and water https://t co/y8gujkv6qo
I don't see the relationship between the money that EU pays and the camps that are being set up. Are you sure you are not making it up?
