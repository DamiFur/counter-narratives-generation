@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
If you are a citizen of a country and a refugee in another country then you are not just economic migrants you are escaping from two different situations.
