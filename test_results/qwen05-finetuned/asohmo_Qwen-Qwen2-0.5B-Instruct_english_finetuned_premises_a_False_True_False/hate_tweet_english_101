@user time to start firing judges who dont detain immigrants so @user can deport if he was detain and not given a bond that citizen would be alive
Just because someone who hasn't even committed a crime yet can't be deported doesn't mean that the judge who decides which immigrants to let in and which to deport is wrong.
