for all the people holding up signs regarding illegal immigrants hand them each a bill to pay the cost of how much these people take from the american taxpayer and i bet they would take down their signs and go home
Just because you don't want to pay for something doesn't mean the immigrants are taking it from you. Did you ever think about why there are open borders in the first place?
