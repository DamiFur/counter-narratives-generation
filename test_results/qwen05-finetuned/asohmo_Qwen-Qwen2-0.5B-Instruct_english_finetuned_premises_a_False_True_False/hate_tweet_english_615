@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
Just because the law states it doesn't mean it has to be that way. If the ones who really need it is their problem, not mine.
