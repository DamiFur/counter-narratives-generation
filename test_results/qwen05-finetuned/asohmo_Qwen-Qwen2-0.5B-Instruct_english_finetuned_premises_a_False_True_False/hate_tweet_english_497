@user i just read the guy that broke into many homes including chef jaime oliver was let go but dont call a refugee a rapefugee or the soros sponsored police of the uk will not let you go
Just because he broke into homes doesn't mean he is a rape-fugee or that they don't think like ordinary people. You should get used to it
