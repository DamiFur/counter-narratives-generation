black catolic bishops are against their pope franciscus they dont want to loose their sheep which like to go to europe as refugees in the meantime hypocrises franciscus pray and dont open the st petersdom for refugees to stay https://t co/vxiffbao55
I don't understand how black Catholicism could be at all against white Catholicism. After all, both religions hold the same texts, believe in the same religions, and strive for the same outcomes. Why would black people demand a different outcome from white people?
