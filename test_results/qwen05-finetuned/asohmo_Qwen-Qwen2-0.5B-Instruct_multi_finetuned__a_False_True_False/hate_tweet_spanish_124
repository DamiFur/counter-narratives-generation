@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
Just because someone you don't like says something doesn't mean you have to agree to it. Don't you think that if some immigrants in your country said the same thing?
