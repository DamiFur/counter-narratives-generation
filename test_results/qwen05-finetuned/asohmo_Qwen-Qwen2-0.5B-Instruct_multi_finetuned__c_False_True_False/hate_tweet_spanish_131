@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
Why should we believe them? They are a minority and have a right to a living wage and healthcare. It's not about "asylum" but about "human"...
