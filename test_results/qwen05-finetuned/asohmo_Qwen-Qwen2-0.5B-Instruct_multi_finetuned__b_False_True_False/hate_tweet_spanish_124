@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
Nobody has the right to a Country. Nobody was born a Countryman, nor is there any reason to believe that they continue to be the same Countryman all their lives.
