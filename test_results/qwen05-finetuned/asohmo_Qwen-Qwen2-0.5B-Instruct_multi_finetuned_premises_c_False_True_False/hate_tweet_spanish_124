@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
Ok, but just because someone is an immigrant doesn't mean they don't have a country. It has nothing to do with what other people think...
