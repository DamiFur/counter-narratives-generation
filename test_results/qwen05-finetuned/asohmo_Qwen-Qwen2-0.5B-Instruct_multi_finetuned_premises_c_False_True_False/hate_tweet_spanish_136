for all the people holding up signs regarding illegal immigrants hand them each a bill to pay the cost of how much these people take from the american taxpayer and i bet they would take down their signs and go home
I don't think they would take off their signs, they are usually asked to stay where they are represented and are not allowed to take anything except for what they brought.
