@user sheme there is no attention on our own people and foodbanks while do you have to be a migrant to be treated with respect?
Maybe there is, but I haven't seen any study showing that. Do you have arguments to show that there isn't attention on our people or foodbanks, or are you just making stuff up about migrants?
