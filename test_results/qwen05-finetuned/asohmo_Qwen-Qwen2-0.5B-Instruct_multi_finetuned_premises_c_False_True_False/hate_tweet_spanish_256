about 3700 refugee medicine doctors are allowed to work in germany in hospitals now they realize that some of them are not on the standard of western medicine and often some buyed the certificats home without knowledge so some patients died https://t co/belfz7m72z
So what are you implying? That these doctors are not trained enough, or that there is something wrong with the system? Why do you accuse them of something like this? You are being xenophobic
