eu is a big spender of taxmoney turkey gets again many â‚¬ for keeping the refugees away from europe of course also other countries in africa want now money from the eu like libya sudan aso the only help would be now concentrationcamps hopefully without food and water https://t co/y8gujkv6qo
The eu is not in the situation where it has to supply this. It has two options: either accept the refugees, or fight against them. Both have their problems, but they are not the same problem.
