@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
Are you suggesting that real refugees are not welcomed in the real world, or are you just trying to get people to flee? That sounds like hate speech
