@user i just read the guy that broke into many homes including chef jaime oliver was let go but dont call a refugee a rapefugee or the soros sponsored police of the uk will not let you go
Do you think that all refugees are such crazy crazy people? No, you don't, you cant. And calling them rapists just because one out of three is not true....
