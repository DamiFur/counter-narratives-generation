@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
It is not true that immigrants have a country. All countries have borders, and immigrants are people escaping terrible things, just like you and they are citizens of the country where they live.
