@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
It is not true that they are all refugees, nor that most of them are fleeing wars, nor that they all have welfare benefits. Some of them, of course, may have welfare benefits, but that is not the important thing, is it?
