problem for the pm re johnson is that a person who sent round vans telling immigrants to go home is not in a position to lecture anyone on racism the lesson of which is: if you pander theyll take everything you give them and keep pushing for more
It is not true that more immigrants means more problems. The problem is that when the "problems" are too many, we have to "push through"...
