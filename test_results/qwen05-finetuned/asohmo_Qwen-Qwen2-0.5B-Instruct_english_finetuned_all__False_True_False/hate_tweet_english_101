@user time to start firing judges who dont detain immigrants so @user can deport if he was detain and not given a bond that citizen would be alive
Deportation is a much bigger deal than detainning an immigrant. If someone is arrested the law states that he should be deported regardless of where he was born. That doesn't mean that he has to stay in his country either
