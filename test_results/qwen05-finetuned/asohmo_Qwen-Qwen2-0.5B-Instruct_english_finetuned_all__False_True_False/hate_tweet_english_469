meanwhile in europe nobody speaks the truth that all of the potential millions of migrants and refugees can not be taken into the euro zone former colonial powers like france &amp britain are not without guilt in the creation of the mess that is most of the african continent today
The truth is that we are all equal before the law, whether you are a native or not, a immigrant or not an immigrant, a male or a female... It's the same for all of us, with the exception of those who were born in your country...
