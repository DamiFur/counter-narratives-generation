@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
It doesn't have anything wrong with it just because they are illegal doesn't mean they should be allowed here. I don't think you understand how the system works.
