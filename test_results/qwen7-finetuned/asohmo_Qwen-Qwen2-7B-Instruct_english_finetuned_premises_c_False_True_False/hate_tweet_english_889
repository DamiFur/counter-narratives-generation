"""@user @user @user it may have to do with plain honest speech so many politicians have the """political speech""" bug theyre accustomed to stating what people want to hear & not what they need to like saying it is hashtag fucktarded to believe the mass hashtag refugee / hashtag rapefugee immigration was good is idiodic"" "
Maybe it has to do with that, but you are wrong. There are politicians who always say what they believe, without adding "please" or "I understand that it is a bad idea, but...". The problem is that you only listen to those you agree with...
