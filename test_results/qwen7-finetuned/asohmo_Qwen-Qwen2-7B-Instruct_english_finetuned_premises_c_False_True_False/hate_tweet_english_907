@user and this is exactly how it should be in england crime is low in slovakia etc but all the scumbags come to to commit crimes as they know they can get away with it - they never return hashtag stop immigration
I don't think there are people who come to commit crimes specifically because they are immigrants. In any case, it has nothing to do with being an immigrant, but with being a criminal.
