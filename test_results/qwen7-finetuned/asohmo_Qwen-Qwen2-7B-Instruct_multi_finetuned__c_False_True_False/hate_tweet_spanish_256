about 3700 refugee medicine doctors are allowed to work in germany in hospitals now they realize that some of them are not on the standard of western medicine and often some buyed the certificats home without knowledge so some patients died https://t co/belfz7m72z
It is unfortunate that some refugee doctors may not have the same level of training as those who were born in this country. However, no one goes into a hospital expecting their doctor to be "perfect". We just ask for them to do their job well.
