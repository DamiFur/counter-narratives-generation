@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
It is not true that none is a refugee. In fact, most of them are, and they are escaping from war and terrible situations to try to find a place where they can have a decent life.
