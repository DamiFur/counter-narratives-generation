@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
Because the law is the law. You can't demand that those who are already in possession of something give it up just because you want it. You can try to get it legally, but you can't take it from someone else.
