iranians either entered via greece or serbia which recklessly grants visas to iranians some iranians now fly into serbia ðÿ‰then leave for richer state in eu indirect support of illegal migration must end or others must impose sanctions on serbia to adjust attitude @user https://t co/pzhlgojaxc
It is not true that visas are given freely to Iranians. In fact, it is very difficult for them to get one. On the other hand, it is not true either that those who manage to get one do so with the intention of going to "richer states". Stop making things up to justify your xenophobia
