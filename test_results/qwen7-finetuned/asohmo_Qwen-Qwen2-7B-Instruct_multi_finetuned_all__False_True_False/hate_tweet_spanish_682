these people are native americans the land you claim is yours was theres until our immigrant ancestors stole it from them heres your small history lesson you should have learned in school thanks for coming to my ted talk https://t co/mbovkjt5rx
It is not true that the land was "there" before us, as if it were waiting for us to "claim" it. The fact is that it has always belonged to someone, and if your ancestors "stole" it, then it is obvious that they could not have "claimed" it.
