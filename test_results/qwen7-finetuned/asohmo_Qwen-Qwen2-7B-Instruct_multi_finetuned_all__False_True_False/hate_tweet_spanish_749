problem for the pm re johnson is that a person who sent round vans telling immigrants to go home is not in a position to lecture anyone on racism the lesson of which is: if you pander theyll take everything you give them and keep pushing for more
I don't think anyone is trying to "pander" to immigrants. I think most people just want to treat them well, as they would want to be treated if they were in their place.
