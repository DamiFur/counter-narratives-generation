@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
Everyone can game the system. If it is unfair, the problem is not in the immigration system, but in the laws. Changing the laws to make the system fair for everyone is always a good idea.
