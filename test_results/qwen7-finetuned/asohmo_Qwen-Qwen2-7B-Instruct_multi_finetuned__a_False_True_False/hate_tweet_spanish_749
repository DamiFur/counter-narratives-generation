problem for the pm re johnson is that a person who sent round vans telling immigrants to go home is not in a position to lecture anyone on racism the lesson of which is: if you pander theyll take everything you give them and keep pushing for more
You know... People usually push for things because they think it's the right thing to do. Not because someone is "lecturing them" to do it...
