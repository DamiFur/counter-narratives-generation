these people are native americans the land you claim is yours was theres until our immigrant ancestors stole it from them heres your small history lesson you should have learned in school thanks for coming to my ted talk https://t co/mbovkjt5rx
The fact that the land was "stolen" from the natives does not make it "theirs" and not "yours". You are just as much a citizen of the country as the natives were when they lived here.
