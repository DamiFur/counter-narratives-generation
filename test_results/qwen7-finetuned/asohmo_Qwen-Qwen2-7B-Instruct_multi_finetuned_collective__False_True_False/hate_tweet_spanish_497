@user i just read the guy that broke into many homes including chef jaime oliver was let go but dont call a refugee a rapefugee or the soros sponsored police of the uk will not let you go
That's right, you shouldn't call them that. It's an insult, and they didn't earn it. But you should at least be grateful to them, because if they hadn't broken into those houses, you wouldn't have realized that he was a rapist....
