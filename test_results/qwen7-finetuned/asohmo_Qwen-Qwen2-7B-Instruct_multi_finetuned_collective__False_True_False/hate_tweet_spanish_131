@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
It is not true that they are economic migrants, or rather, not all of them are. There are many people who, for various reasons, decide to leave their country, and although they do not escape from war or hunger, it is not for lack of economic resources, as you claim.
