@user and this is exactly how it should be in england crime is low in slovakia etc but all the scumbags come to to commit crimes as they know they can get away with it - they never return hashtag stop immigration
I don't know, I've never seen a country where crime is so low that no one wants to go and commit it. Do you have any proof to support that this is actually happening?
