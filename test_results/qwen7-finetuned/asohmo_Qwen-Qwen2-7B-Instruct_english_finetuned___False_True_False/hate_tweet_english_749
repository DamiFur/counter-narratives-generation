problem for the pm re johnson is that a person who sent round vans telling immigrants to go home is not in a position to lecture anyone on racism the lesson of which is: if you pander theyll take everything you give them and keep pushing for more
I don't think that's the lesson. In fact, I think the opposite is true. If you don't give in to them, they'll stop bothering you.
