@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
You call them invaders because they didn't come in the way you think they should. In other words, you are not letting them in. That doesn't make them invaders, that makes you close the door on them.
