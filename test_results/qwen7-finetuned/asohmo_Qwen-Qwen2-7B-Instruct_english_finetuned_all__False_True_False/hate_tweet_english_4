rich african countries dont take in african migrants rich muslim countries dont take in muslim migrants rich latin american countries dont take it latin migrants but white countries are suppose to accept them ??
Just because someone is rich doesn't mean they are going to accept anyone at the door. Also, just because someone is a citizen doesn't mean that person is going to do the right thing. You can't link nationality and morality, it doesn't work that way.
