@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
You assume they are economic migrants because you don't speak their language, you don't know where they come from, and you don't understand their culture. Maybe they are refugees, and you are just another xenophobe hiding his prejudice behind a keyboard.
