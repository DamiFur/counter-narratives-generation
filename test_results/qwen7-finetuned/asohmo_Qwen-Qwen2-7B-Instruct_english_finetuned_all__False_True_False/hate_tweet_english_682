these people are native americans the land you claim is yours was theres until our immigrant ancestors stole it from them heres your small history lesson you should have learned in school thanks for coming to my ted talk https://t co/mbovkjt5rx
I don't think anyone would deny that at some point in history, people stole land from the original owners. But you can't go around claiming land for someone who doesn't need it, just because your ancestors "stole" it....
