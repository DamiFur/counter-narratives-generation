@user and this is exactly how it should be in england crime is low in slovakia etc but all the scumbags come to to commit crimes as they know they can get away with it - they never return hashtag stop immigration
If the people who escape are criminals, maybe we should improve the system, instead of running everyone off. Don't you think?
