@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
That doesn't make any sense. You can't claim that immigrants don't have a country and at the same time say that it's okay for you to take over theirs. It's not.
