@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
If they were actually here illegally, they wouldn't be able to claim asylum. It only makes sense to me that if you are escaping from a war, and you can't go home because your home is not safe, it makes sense that you would try to find somewhere else to go. If you deport people the moment they arrive, you are going to end up with a lot of them just wandering around trying to get somewhere safe.
