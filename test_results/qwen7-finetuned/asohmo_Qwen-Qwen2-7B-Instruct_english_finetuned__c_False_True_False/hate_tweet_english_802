@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
If they were refugees, they would have gone directly to the country where they were going to be resettled, without trying to make a living first. That doesn't make sense
