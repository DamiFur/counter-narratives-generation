regardless of intent the term " undocumented immigrant " is incorrect because illegal aliens are foreigners (i e aliens ) who are unlawfully present in the united states (i e illegal) https://t co/aarjtduwya https://t co/hkrv7mpzok
The term "undocumented" is used because you don't need to be here illegally to be an immigrant. You just need to not have your documentation with you. It's a play on words, it doesn't really make sense literally, but it works figuratively.
