@user i just read the guy that broke into many homes including chef jaime oliver was let go but dont call a refugee a rapefugee or the soros sponsored police of the uk will not let you go
You are being racist. You are assuming that if a refugee is arrested it is because he is a rapist. When in fact there are many non-refugees who are.
