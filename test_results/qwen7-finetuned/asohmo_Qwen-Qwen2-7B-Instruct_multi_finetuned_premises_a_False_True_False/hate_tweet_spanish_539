@user will islam ever be at peace with its self as it goes to war with itsel f no wonder uk people do not accept its refugees
I don't think we should judge a whole religion for the actions of a few people. Also, we should consider that if refugees are rejected is because of other reasons, like too many of them, or coming from too far.
