these people are native americans the land you claim is yours was theres until our immigrant ancestors stole it from them heres your small history lesson you should have learned in school thanks for coming to my ted talk https://t co/mbovkjt5rx
The fact that the land was "there" before the immigrants arrived does not imply that it was "yours". The immigrants have just as much right to be there as the natives did.
