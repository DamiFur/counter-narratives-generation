learn from most of hashtag europe thats been hashtag invaded by mostly muslims then look at hashtag italy hashtag poland & others who elected politicians to hashtag stopim migration & hashtag deportillegals hashtag sweden & hashtag germany now trying to reverse the huge mistakes of unlimited migration of ppl who refuse to hashtag assimilate
Invaded is a strong word, and is clearly biased. What you are really saying is that you don't like how these people live their lives. There is nothing wrong with that, as long as it doesn't hurt anyone.
