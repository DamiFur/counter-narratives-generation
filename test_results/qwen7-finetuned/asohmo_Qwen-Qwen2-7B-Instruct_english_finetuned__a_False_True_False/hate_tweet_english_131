@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
They are called immigrants for a reason, you know? They are trying to find a better place to live, not to "steal" the country or "invade" anything. Most of them don't even realize that they are "cheating"....
