@user " can you think of a place that has been improved by mass immigration or the movements of large numbers of refugees ?" "not one the immigration policies in europe are a disaster youre destroying europe youre destroying the culture√¢
It is not true that you are destroying the culture, nor is it true that only immigrants are blamed for that. There are xenophobous and racist xenophobes who blame the immigrants for everything wrong, but that does not make it true.
