@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
You are assuming that if they don't stop at Turkey is because they are looking for welfare benefits but you don't know if that is really why they are going to Europe. You are just making up your mind
