@user tough decisions mean easy ones ban those families who supported isis in germany they murdered many and if you do not learn from recent events like mass immigration rises in rape and crime family isis deserve no return to the country the
You are being biased, which is easy when you don't like them. But you're skipping over something important, the fact that they are families. It's not that they support ISIS, but that those supporting ISIS are immigrants. If you banned all immigrants, you would be banning the good ones too, you know that, don't you?
