@user who care for these children of criminal refugees really they play no role in times of overpopulation
Who are these people you speak of, that care about children? The problem, you see, is not overpopulation, but the opposite. It's underpopulation. We have the worst overpopulation problem in the history of the world, and it's in the Global South, not the Global North.
