@user i just read the guy that broke into many homes including chef jaime oliver was let go but dont call a refugee a rapefugee or the soros sponsored police of the uk will not let you go
You are being biased, which is easy when you don't like them. But you're skipping over something important, the fact that he was released is because the evidence wasn't solid enough, it has nothing to do with refugees.
