hungary referendum: 98% of voters reject islamic immigration - muslims are offended - free speech time - https://t co/dlnslapka7 @user
You claim that the hungarian voters have rejected islamic immigration, but you don't provide any source and you clearly don't know how many people voted. The only thing clear is that you are a xenophobe who only supports xenophobia because you are unable to tolerate other religions different from yours
