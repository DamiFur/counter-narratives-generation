@user sheme there is no attention on our own people and foodbanks while do you have to be a migrant to be treated with respect?
Everyone deserves respect, our people too. The problem is that when you treat everyone the same, the "good" don't get anything, and the "bad" stay the same. If you want to improve our people's life, you can try to get out of that logic
