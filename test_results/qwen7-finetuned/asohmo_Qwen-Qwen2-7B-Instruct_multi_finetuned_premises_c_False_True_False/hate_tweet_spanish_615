@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
Because the law has changed over time, and it is not right to expect that of you, but it is unfair to expect it of the thousands of immigrants who arrive here seeking a better life.
