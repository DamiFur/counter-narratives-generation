japan is able to keep clean his country from refugees 2017 they accept only 20 from nearly 20 000 requests this is worldrecord https://t co/y6xvy2gxbc
I think those numbers are made up to make Japan look bad. Many countries don't accept refugees, it's true, but most of them don't make up ridiculous numbers to justify it.
