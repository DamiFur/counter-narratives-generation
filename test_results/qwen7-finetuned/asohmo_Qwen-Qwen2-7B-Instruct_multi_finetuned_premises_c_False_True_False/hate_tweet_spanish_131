@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
It is not true that none of them are real refugees. There are many people who, for different reasons, are unable to stay in their country, and the important thing is that they are not criminals
