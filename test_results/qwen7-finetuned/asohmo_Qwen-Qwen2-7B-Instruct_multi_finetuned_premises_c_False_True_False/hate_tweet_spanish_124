@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
I don't think that's the same thing. The fact that you are a xenophobe does not give you the right to deny the existence of other countries.
