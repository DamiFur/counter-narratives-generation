problem for the pm re johnson is that a person who sent round vans telling immigrants to go home is not in a position to lecture anyone on racism the lesson of which is: if you pander theyll take everything you give them and keep pushing for more
Maybe if you didn't give them everything they asked for, there wouldn't be a problem. But you know that's not how it works, right?
