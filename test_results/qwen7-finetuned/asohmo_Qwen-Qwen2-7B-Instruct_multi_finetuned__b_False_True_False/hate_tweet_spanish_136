for all the people holding up signs regarding illegal immigrants hand them each a bill to pay the cost of how much these people take from the american taxpayer and i bet they would take down their signs and go home
Do you have any idea how much it costs to maintain a foreigner's status in a country? Even if they are costing taxpayers money, they are not that expensive, and in any case, it is not the foreigners' fault if your country does not enforce immigration laws.
