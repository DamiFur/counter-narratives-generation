@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
The fact that they are immigrants does not mean that they have no rights. In fact, they have the same rights as anyone else
