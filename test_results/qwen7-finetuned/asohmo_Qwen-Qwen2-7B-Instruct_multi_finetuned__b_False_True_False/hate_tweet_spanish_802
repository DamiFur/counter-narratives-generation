@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
They come from countries that are not at war, that's why they are called "economic migrants" and not "refugees".
