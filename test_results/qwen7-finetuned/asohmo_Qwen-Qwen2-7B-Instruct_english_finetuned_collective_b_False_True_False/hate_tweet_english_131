@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
They are economic migrants, but they are also refugees, because leaving your country is always an emergency, and when you have nothing and you don't know where you are going you are going to be called "invaders"?
