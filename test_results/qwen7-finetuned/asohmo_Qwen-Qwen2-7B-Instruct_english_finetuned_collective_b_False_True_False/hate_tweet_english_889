"""@user @user @user it may have to do with plain honest speech so many politicians have the """political speech""" bug theyre accustomed to stating what people want to hear & not what they need to like saying it is hashtag fucktarded to believe the mass hashtag refugee / hashtag rapefugee immigration was good is idiodic"" "
It is not true that they are rapists, or that most of them are. In any case, it doesn't justify calling them refugees, because being a refugee has nothing to do with whether or not you are a rapist. Being a refugee is a way of saying that you had to flee in a hurry, usually with few or no belongings, and that there are people or forces that would have liked to stop you from leaving.
