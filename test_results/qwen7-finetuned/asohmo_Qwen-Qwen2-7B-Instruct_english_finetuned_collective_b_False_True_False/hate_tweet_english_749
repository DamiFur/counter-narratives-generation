problem for the pm re johnson is that a person who sent round vans telling immigrants to go home is not in a position to lecture anyone on racism the lesson of which is: if you pander theyll take everything you give them and keep pushing for more
It's not true that immigrants are the only ones who "keep on asking for more". Material resources are limited, but there are many other groups in society that also need investment in housing, health, education, etc.
