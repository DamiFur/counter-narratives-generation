@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
I think you underestimate these people if you think they make this trip in order to get welfare. They are fleeing a war or a crisis and of course they are going to try to get help when they arrive
