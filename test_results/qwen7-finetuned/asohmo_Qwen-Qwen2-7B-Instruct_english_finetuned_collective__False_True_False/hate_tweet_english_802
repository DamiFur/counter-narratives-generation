@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
It's funny, because I've never seen a refugee study to see which country would be the most convenient to go to. They escape from war, not knowing where they are going or what they are going to do.
