@user i just read the guy that broke into many homes including chef jaime oliver was let go but dont call a refugee a rapefugee or the soros sponsored police of the uk will not let you go
Do you have any proof that this guy was a refugee? Because I think it's just racism to assume that someone who broke into houses is a rapist just because he's a refugee
