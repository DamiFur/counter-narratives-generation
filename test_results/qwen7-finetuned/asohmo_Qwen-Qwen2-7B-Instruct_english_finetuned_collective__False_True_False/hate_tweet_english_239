so the economic migration crisis will now get rapidly worse into 2021 and anyone opining that a province like ontario can absorb a million people into the social infrastructure is not understanding the macro events underway and the system collapse that would trigger
I don't think there is a real "migration crisis". People are just trying to find a better place to live. As long as wars don't break out, I don't see any "system collapse" on the horizon.
