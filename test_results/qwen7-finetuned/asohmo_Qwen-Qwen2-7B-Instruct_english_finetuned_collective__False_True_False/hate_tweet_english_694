@user stop being spineless and tell the eu its our country and stop migrants dictating to us via eu
Our country is a democracy, and in a democracy the decisions are not made by a small group of people, but by all of us, and the immigrants are part of us now. It is not a matter of "doing what the immigrants want", but of doing what is right.
