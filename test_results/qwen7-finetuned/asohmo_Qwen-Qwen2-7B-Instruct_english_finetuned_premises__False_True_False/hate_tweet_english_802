@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
It is not true that they are all looking for welfare. Many of them have no choice but to escape, and sometimes the only way to escape is by boat.
