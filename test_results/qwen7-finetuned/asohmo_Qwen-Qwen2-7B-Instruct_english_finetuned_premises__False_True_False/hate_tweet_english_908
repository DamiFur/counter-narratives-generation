learn from most of hashtag europe thats been hashtag invaded by mostly muslims then look at hashtag italy hashtag poland & others who elected politicians to hashtag stopim migration & hashtag deportillegals hashtag sweden & hashtag germany now trying to reverse the huge mistakes of unlimited migration of ppl who refuse to hashtag assimilate
I don't think it's a huge mistake. After all, it's just people from another culture living in another culture, trying to make a living. What's the problem with that?
