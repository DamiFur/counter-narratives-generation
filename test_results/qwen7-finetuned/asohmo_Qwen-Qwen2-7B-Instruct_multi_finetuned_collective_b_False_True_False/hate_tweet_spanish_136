for all the people holding up signs regarding illegal immigrants hand them each a bill to pay the cost of how much these people take from the american taxpayer and i bet they would take down their signs and go home
Do you have any idea how much do you pay for taxes? and how much of that is used on the budget for immigrants? probably a lot of money you don't want to see go that way....
