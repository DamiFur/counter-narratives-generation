@user i just read the guy that broke into many homes including chef jaime oliver was let go but dont call a refugee a rapefugee or the soros sponsored police of the uk will not let you go
It is not true that refugees are criminals or rapists. Most of them have not even committed any kind of minor crime. And they are not more likely to be rapists than locals are.
