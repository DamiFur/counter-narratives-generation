meanwhile in europe nobody speaks the truth that all of the potential millions of migrants and refugees can not be taken into the euro zone former colonial powers like france &amp britain are not without guilt in the creation of the mess that is most of the african continent today
What " guilt " are you referring to? If a country is responsible for the problems of another country, then it should also be responsible for solving them, and providing support without any kind of judgment. This is not happening and it is very unfair
