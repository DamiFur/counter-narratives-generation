about 3700 refugee medicine doctors are allowed to work in germany in hospitals now they realize that some of them are not on the standard of western medicine and often some buyed the certificats home without knowledge so some patients died https://t co/belfz7m72z
Why would you assume that refugee doctors didn't study? Maybe they did, maybe they didn't, but you're assuming they didn't just because they are refugees? That's biased
