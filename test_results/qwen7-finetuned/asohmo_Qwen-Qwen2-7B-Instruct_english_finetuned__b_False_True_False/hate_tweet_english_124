@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
The fact that they are immigrants means that they left their country, but of course, they have the right to be in any country they want, as long as they don't break the laws of that country.
