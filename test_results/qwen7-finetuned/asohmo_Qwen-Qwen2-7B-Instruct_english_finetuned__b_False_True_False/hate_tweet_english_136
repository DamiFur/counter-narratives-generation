for all the people holding up signs regarding illegal immigrants hand them each a bill to pay the cost of how much these people take from the american taxpayer and i bet they would take down their signs and go home
Do you know how much money it actually costs for each immigrant? Do you know that in fact they pay more than they take? You are just a xenophobe trying to cover up your hate
