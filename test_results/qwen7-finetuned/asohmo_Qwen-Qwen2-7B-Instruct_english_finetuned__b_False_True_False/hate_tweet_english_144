black catolic bishops are against their pope franciscus they dont want to loose their sheep which like to go to europe as refugees in the meantime hypocrises franciscus pray and dont open the st petersdom for refugees to stay https://t co/vxiffbao55
I don't understand the relationship between a bishop and his or her "flock". Why would the "flock" want to go to Europe? Wouldn't they want to be with their bishop?
