learn from most of hashtag europe thats been hashtag invaded by mostly muslims then look at hashtag italy hashtag poland & others who elected politicians to hashtag stopim migration & hashtag deportillegals hashtag sweden & hashtag germany now trying to reverse the huge mistakes of unlimited migration of ppl who refuse to hashtag assimilate
Europe has not been invaded by Muslims. Muslims have been here since the 7th century. They are a part of the fabric of Europe. It is not true that they refuse to assimilate.
