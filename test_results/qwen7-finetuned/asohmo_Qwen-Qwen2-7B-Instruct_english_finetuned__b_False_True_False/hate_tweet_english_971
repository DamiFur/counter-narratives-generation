" spoken like a true globalist a borderless one world government has always been their goal no borders means social mayhem the more chaos they foment the more the public will demand an all powerful superstate ordo ab chao (out of chaos order) is their motto hashtag buildthatwall"
It is not true that the world is borderless and that the governments want it that way. People have the right to cross borders as long as they respect the laws of the countries they visit. The problem is that immigrants sometimes break the laws, but that doesn't mean that all of them do, or that all the governments want to lose control over their countries
