problem for the pm re johnson is that a person who sent round vans telling immigrants to go home is not in a position to lecture anyone on racism the lesson of which is: if you pander theyll take everything you give them and keep pushing for more
Maybe you're right, but I don't think that's the lesson. The lesson is that there are crazy people out there, we should not be like them.
