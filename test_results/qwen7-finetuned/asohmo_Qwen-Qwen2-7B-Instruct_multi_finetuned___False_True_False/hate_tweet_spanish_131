@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
You call them invaders because you don't like them, but they are only seeking to make a living. As long as they don't harm anyone, there is no reason to kick them out.
