japan is able to keep clean his country from refugees 2017 they accept only 20 from nearly 20 000 requests this is worldrecord https://t co/y6xvy2gxbc
I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing. At least they are not accepting them all, although I don't understand why they would accept anyone if they are so clean.
