@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
I don't think that's what he meant. I think he was saying that it's okay that they don't have a country of their own. I think that's fine too, as long as they don't try to take over ours.
