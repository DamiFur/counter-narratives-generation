@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
Because the law says so. You can't invent a rule that says "you can't claim asylum if you've been here for a long time". It doesn't make sense....
