@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
I don't see any fraud. If someone has been in the US for years and decides to file for asylum, that is their right. You can't deport people just because they came from outside a year ago. It's not that way how it works.
