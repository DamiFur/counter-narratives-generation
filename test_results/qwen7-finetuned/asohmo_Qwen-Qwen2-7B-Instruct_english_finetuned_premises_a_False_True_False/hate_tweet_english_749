problem for the pm re johnson is that a person who sent round vans telling immigrants to go home is not in a position to lecture anyone on racism the lesson of which is: if you pander theyll take everything you give them and keep pushing for more
The problem, as I see it, is not that. The problem is that, instead of blaming the immigrants for all the problems, we could try to see where the mistakes are being made and correct them, don't you think?
