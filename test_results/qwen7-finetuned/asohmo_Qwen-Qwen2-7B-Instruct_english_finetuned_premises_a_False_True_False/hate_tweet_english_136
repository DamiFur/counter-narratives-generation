for all the people holding up signs regarding illegal immigrants hand them each a bill to pay the cost of how much these people take from the american taxpayer and i bet they would take down their signs and go home
I understand what you are trying to get at, but I think you are being too rough on these people. Most of them don't make much money and don't take much from the taxpayer. Don't you think this money is used for other things too? And even if they do take money, don't you think it would be better to find a way to let them access it legally, instead of charging them for something they didn't do?
