@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
You are assuming that there are "real refugees" and "economic migrants" and that the former would do things differently. There is no evidence that this is actually the case, and in any case, both are just people trying to get ahead, in a system that does not make it easy for anyone.... They are not so different after all.
