@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
Well, actually, both are the same, there is only one country called United States, you know? And if someone doesn't like the immigrants, it's because they are trying to "take over" the country, and the best way to do that, is by having children, which, by the way, is a right that every human being has, you know?
