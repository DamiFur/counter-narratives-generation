@user time to start firing judges who dont detain immigrants so @user can deport if he was detain and not given a bond that citizen would be alive
I understand what you are trying to get at, but I think you are being too hasty. Maybe the judge did not detain the immigrant because he realized that he was not at fault for the death, or maybe he committed the crime elsewhere, so there is no reason to detain him.
