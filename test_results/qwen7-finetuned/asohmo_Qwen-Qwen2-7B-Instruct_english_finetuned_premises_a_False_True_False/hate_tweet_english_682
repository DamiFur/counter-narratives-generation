these people are native americans the land you claim is yours was theres until our immigrant ancestors stole it from them heres your small history lesson you should have learned in school thanks for coming to my ted talk https://t co/mbovkjt5rx
You say it as if it were a fact, but it is not. The Native Americans had no way of knowing that "our" ancestors would buy land from them. It is not a crime, much less an invasion, to buy something. If anything, the natives should adapt to the fact that they are no longer the only owners of the land.
