street interview whit italians "send all migrants back to where they came from they block streets to pray " - free speech time - https://t co/d5dqr8pg3r @user
I don't think it's a good idea to send back all the immigrants just because some of them pray in the streets. In any case, it sure can't be worse than the xenophobia we see on twitter, right?
