@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
Because the law states that those who have been here more than a year cannot claim asylum, it doesn't mean that those who arrived late are going to prison. It's not that cut and dry
