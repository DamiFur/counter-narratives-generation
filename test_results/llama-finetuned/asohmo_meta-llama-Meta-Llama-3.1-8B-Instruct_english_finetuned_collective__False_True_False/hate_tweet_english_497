@user i just read the guy that broke into many homes including chef jaime oliver was let go but dont call a refugee a rapefugee or the soros sponsored police of the uk will not let you go
You can call him rapist, because that's what he did. If you associate refugees with rapists, you are missing the point that most of them never committed any crime
