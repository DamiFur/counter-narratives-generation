@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
So, you are saying that if someone from Mexico comes to the US, we have to let them stay, because they are just "immigrants", and we are all "immigrants" in a sense... I don't see any problem with that, we are not going to throw someone out just because of where they were born...
