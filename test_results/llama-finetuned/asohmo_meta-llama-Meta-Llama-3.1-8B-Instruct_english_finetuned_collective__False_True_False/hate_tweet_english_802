@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
If they were refugees, why would they not stop at Turkey? You are underestimating them, they are escaping for their lives, of course they are going to try to get to the "welfare" country, you would too if you were in their place
