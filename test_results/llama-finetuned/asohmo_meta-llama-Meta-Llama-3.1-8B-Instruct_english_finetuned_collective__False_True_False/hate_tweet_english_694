@user stop being spineless and tell the eu its our country and stop migrants dictating to us via eu
Our country? Really? You mean the country where no one is born? The country that doesn't recognize nationality by birthright? You're not even a citizen, and you're already talking about "our country"... Spineless? I'd say you're being aggressive towards people who don't do anything to you.
