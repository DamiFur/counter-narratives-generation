about 3700 refugee medicine doctors are allowed to work in germany in hospitals now they realize that some of them are not on the standard of western medicine and often some buyed the certificats home without knowledge so some patients died https://t co/belfz7m72z
How can you be so sure that it was the doctors who bought the certificates who were not up to par? Maybe it was just one of them, and the others didn't know anything about it.
