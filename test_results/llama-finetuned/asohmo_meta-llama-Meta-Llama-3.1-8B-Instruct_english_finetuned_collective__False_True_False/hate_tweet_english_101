@user time to start firing judges who dont detain immigrants so @user can deport if he was detain and not given a bond that citizen would be alive
Immigrants are not a threat to citizens more than citizens are a threat to other citizens. Most of them are just trying to get ahead finding better job oportunities. Time to stop blaming immigrants for all the wrongs in your society
