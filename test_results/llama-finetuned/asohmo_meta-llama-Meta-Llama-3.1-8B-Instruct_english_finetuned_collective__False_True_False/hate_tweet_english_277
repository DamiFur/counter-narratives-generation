@user @user americas public assistance medicare medicaid ss et al are strained and americans "benefits" are being cut not even able to maintain status quo no immigrants should be granted entry that need assistance hashtag nodaca hashtag norefuge
The fact that there are people in need is not a good reason to close the door to anyone. There are always going to be people in need, there will always be people who cannot make it on their own. That's why we have social services, to help those in need. If you want to help, you can always donate to those in need, or volunteer your time. But to say "no immigrants" just because some people need assistance, it's not right
