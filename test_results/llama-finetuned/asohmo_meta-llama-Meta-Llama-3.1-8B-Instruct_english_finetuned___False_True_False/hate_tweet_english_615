@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
You are assuming that the law can be interpreted in only one way, but you are wrong. In fact, the asylum system is designed to protect people in desperate situations from being deported to places where they will be harmed, and it makes no sense to deny it to people who have already suffered so much to get where they are....
