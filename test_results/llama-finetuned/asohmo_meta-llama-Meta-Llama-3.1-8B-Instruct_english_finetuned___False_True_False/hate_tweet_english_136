for all the people holding up signs regarding illegal immigrants hand them each a bill to pay the cost of how much these people take from the american taxpayer and i bet they would take down their signs and go home
 You are proposing to solve the problem by running people off with bills. I don't see any ethical problem with immigrants taking advantage of the system, after all, that's what it is there for.
