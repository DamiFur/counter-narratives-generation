Do you have any proof that immigrants vote in higher percentages for one party or another? I doubt that 80% of them vote the same way you vote.And why would they vote that way? Maybe because that's the only option they have, or maybe because that's what they were raised to believe. But you are assuming they have the same opinions as you, and that's wrong.As for the wall, I think it's just a waste of money. There are better ways to control borders without making life difficult for anyone.
