"good for bulgaria but their leaders also have responsibility to secure their border to prevent migrants from roaming northward actions must start matching rhetoric in europe this is what makes hashtag orban unique unlike others orban "walks his talk" and is a man of action hashtag hungary https://t co/gxjkizdndo"
I don't see the relationship between migrating and securing the border. Migrating has been going on for thousands of years, how can you say it "starts from the top"?
