" the ngo rescueship lifeline will now go to malta this is the wrong signal for all the humancatcher from the ngos the crew should send into jail because the have ignored the law and the refugees should be brought back to libya https://t co/hp1yvydepf"
The law states that refugees cannot be pushed back to the place they came from. As long as they are on a ship they are under international law, and not national law. Therefore, they can't be sent to jail. The only option is to let them off at the nearest safe port, which in this case would be Malta.
