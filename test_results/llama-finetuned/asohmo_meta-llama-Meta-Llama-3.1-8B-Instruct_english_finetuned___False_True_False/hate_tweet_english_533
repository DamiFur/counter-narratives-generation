@user theres an agenda jprdan: white genocide is a crime eu funded report tells journalists not to write negative articles on migrant crisis "it even urges them to report colleagues to the authorities for hate speech crimes "https://t
I don't know what "white genocide" means, but it sounds like a conspiracy theory. I don't think there is an agenda to fund reports about migrant crisis in a way that journalists should write only positive things. I also don't think it's right to report colleagues for hate speech, unless they are doing it professionally, of course.
