problem for the pm re johnson is that a person who sent round vans telling immigrants to go home is not in a position to lecture anyone on racism the lesson of which is: if you pander theyll take everything you give them and keep pushing for more
I don't understand, are you saying that this person did something wrong? tell me about it, but I'm sure he was young, and made mistakes, just like everyone else....
