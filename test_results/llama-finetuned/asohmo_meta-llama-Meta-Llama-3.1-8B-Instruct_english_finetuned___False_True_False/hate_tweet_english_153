comparatively our own inner city youth & fellow americans live like 3rd class citizens while illegals are housed at ice centers that rival the best elementary schools & college dorms in the country hashtag buildthatwall @user @user @user @user @user
You are saying that you are going to build a wall to improve the lives of our citizens. I doubt very much that building a wall along the entire border is going to improve anything except perhaps the lives of a few contractors.And by the way, you know that the border is the poorest region in the country, right? The worst schools, the worst housing, the worst healthcare... So much to improve, and you want to improve it by... building a wall.
