comparatively our own inner city youth & fellow americans live like 3rd class citizens while illegals are housed at ice centers that rival the best elementary schools & college dorms in the country hashtag buildthatwall @user @user @user @user @user
You are blinded by predjudice. Illegals are housed in those conditions because they are people, just like you and me, and they deserve to be treated like that. Your own "fellow americans" live in worse conditions, but you don't seem to care about them as much as you "care" about immigrants
