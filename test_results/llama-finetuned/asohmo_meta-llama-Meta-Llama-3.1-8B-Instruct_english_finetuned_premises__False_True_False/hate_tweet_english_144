black catolic bishops are against their pope franciscus they dont want to loose their sheep which like to go to europe as refugees in the meantime hypocrises franciscus pray and dont open the st petersdom for refugees to stay https://t co/vxiffbao55
I don't understand why you try so hard to make us believe that all refugees are bad. You know that is not true, and you know it is not easy for them to decide to leave everything and run away.On the other hand, if the bishops don't let the refugees in, then they are the bad guys, and you should be angry with them, not the refugees.So, what are you really trying to say?
