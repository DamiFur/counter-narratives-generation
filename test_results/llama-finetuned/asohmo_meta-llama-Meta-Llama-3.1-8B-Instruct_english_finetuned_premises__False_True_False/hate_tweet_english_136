for all the people holding up signs regarding illegal immigrants hand them each a bill to pay the cost of how much these people take from the american taxpayer and i bet they would take down their signs and go home
I doubt that everyone who disagrees with you is an immigrant, and I doubt that all immigrants take money from the American taxpayer. So, I doubt that everyone would agree to pay more taxes to fight against people who do nothing to them.
