@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
If the law states that asylum can only be claimed within a certain time frame, then the deportation laws need to be revised. You can't hold people accountable for something that is not their fault, and at the same time, violate the human rights of those who did nothing wrong.
