about 3700 refugee medicine doctors are allowed to work in germany in hospitals now they realize that some of them are not on the standard of western medicine and often some buyed the certificats home without knowledge so some patients died https://t co/belfz7m72z
I think you are being biased, but let me tell you that it is not true. They are allowed, but they have to pass the same tests as the rest of the doctors, in the same way that you cannot buy a medical degree, neither refugees nor "natives"...
