@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
If by country you mean the one where you were born, then no, they don't have the same right as you do. You can't expect that all immigrants speak your language or follow your customs. That's not how it works....
