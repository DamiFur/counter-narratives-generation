problem for the pm re johnson is that a person who sent round vans telling immigrants to go home is not in a position to lecture anyone on racism the lesson of which is: if you pander theyll take everything you give them and keep pushing for more
I don't see the relationship between "go home" and "you're a racist". I mean, if you think they should go home, it's obvious that you don't consider them "one of us". But that doesn't make you a racist, just a xenophobe.
