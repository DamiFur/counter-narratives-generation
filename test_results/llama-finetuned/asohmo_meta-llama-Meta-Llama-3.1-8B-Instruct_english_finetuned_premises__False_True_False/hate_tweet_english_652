@user " can you think of a place that has been improved by mass immigration or the movements of large numbers of refugees ?" "not one the immigration policies in europe are a disaster youre destroying europe youre destroying the culture√¢
I don't know, I mean, maybe if you move to another country you'll see that it is actually a disaster, and not just an opinion. But I doubt it, after all, they usually move for a reason, and that reason is that they want to improve their life, and by extension, they are improving the country where they live.
