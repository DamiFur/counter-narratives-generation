@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
It is not true that they are all economic migrants, many of them are escaping from war and there is no reason to believe that they are going to be a "disaster" for the countries where they live.
