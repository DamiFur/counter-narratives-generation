@user time to start firing judges who dont detain immigrants so @user can deport if he was detain and not given a bond that citizen would be alive
Immigrants are not a threat to citizens. It is not possible that a judge would decide not to detain someone who is not a threat. Something else must be going on that we are not aware of. I would not draw conclusions based on a single case.
