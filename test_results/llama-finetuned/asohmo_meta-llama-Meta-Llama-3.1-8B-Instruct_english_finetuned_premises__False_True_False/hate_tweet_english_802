@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
If they were refugees, they would not be taking the risk of dying in the sea trying to enter Europe. They are not "posing as refugees", they are just trying to get ahead finding better job oportunities on the west.
