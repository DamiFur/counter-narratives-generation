comparatively our own inner city youth & fellow americans live like 3rd class citizens while illegals are housed at ice centers that rival the best elementary schools & college dorms in the country hashtag buildthatwall @user @user @user @user @user
<|end_header_id|>I don't think the comparison you make is fair. The conditions of the houses of non-citizens are not as good as those of citizens, I agree, but that doesn't mean that the citizens are treated poorly, in fact, if you visit some houses of citizens you will see that many of them are not as comfortable as you think.
