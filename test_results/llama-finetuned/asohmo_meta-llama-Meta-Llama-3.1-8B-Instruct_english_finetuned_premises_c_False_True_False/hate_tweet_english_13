It's not true that money destined for aid to these people is going "directly" to them. In fact, a big part of it goes to the intermediaries, i.e., the employers. If you really want to stop the aid, you should demand that it be reduced to 0, instead of complaining about the "abuse" of something that doesn't really belong to you.
