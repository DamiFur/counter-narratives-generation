Is it really "drunken refugees"? Or is it just that they don't have anything better to do? You know, like going to a bar and getting drunk, it's not really the same, but I understand what you mean. But still, there has to be something better in life, don't you think? Like, I don't know, a job, or a home, or... oh wait, they already have those things, but they're not enough for you. Sorry, buddy, but I just can't get on board with your xenophobia.
