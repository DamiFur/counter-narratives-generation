@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
<|end_header_id|>I don't think there is such a law. Asylum can be claimed at any time, no matter how long you've been in the country. In fact, the longer you wait, the less likely you are to be granted it.
