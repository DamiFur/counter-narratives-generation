A silent coup, you say? Well, if we were to take all the conspiracies you've mentioned and piece them together, we'd see that it's just a bunch of lies used to attack a political opponent. If you really want to talk about coups, you should worry about those against democracy, like the one we saw a few years ago, where the people voted for a president and you guys didn't like it.
