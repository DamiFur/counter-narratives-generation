for all the people holding up signs regarding illegal immigrants hand them each a bill to pay the cost of how much these people take from the american taxpayer and i bet they would take down their signs and go home
I doubt that the people holding the signs are concerned with saving money. If that's what really bothers them, they would be protesting against things like wars and corruption, which cost much much more to the taxpayer.
