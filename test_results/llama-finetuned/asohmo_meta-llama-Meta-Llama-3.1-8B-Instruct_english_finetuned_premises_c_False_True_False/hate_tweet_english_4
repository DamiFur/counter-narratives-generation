rich african countries dont take in african migrants rich muslim countries dont take in muslim migrants rich latin american countries dont take it latin migrants but white countries are suppose to accept them ??
Just because a country is rich does not mean that it does not accept migrants. In any case, accepting or not accepting migrants has nothing to do with race or religion. The decisions have to do with political and economic reasons.
