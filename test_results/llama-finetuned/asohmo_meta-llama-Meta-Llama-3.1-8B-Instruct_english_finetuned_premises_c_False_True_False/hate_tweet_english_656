@user sheme there is no attention on our own people and foodbanks while do you have to be a migrant to be treated with respect?
<|end_header_id|>There is no contradiction. You can worry about your own problems and still be concerned about those of others. Although it is true that the government should prioritize the need of its own people, it does not mean that we should not help those in need, no matter where they come from.
