@user and this is exactly how it should be in england crime is low in slovakia etc but all the scumbags come to to commit crimes as they know they can get away with it - they never return hashtag stop immigration
You are saying that crimes are low in Slovakia, which is true. But you can't know that all the scum of other countries go there to commit crimes, because you have no data to support it. In fact, if crimes are low, it is likely that they are not going there to commit them.
