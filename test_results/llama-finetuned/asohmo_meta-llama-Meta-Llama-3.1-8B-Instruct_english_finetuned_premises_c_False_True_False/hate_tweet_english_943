I understand that you want to protect our borders, but building a wall is not going to do that. In fact, it will only serve as a good laugh for the rest of the world. As for deporting all illegals, well, that's just not possible. And as for nodaca, well, it's not a bad idea, but you have to know that it's not going to work that way. You have to offer them a better life, not a worse one.
