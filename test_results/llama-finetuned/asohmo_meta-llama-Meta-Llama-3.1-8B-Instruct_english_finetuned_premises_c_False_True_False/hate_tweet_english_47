immigration gone crazy 100 trainee doctors from abroad what about nurse practitioners who are their equivalent get pain peanuts and are trained and come from the uk
What is the problem, or are you suggesting that the UK is not generating enough trained doctors and nurses to cover all the vacancies? I don't buy it, there is always enough of everything, we just need to make sure that the "right" people get it...
