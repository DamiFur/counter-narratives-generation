black catolic bishops are against their pope franciscus they dont want to loose their sheep which like to go to europe as refugees in the meantime hypocrises franciscus pray and dont open the st petersdom for refugees to stay https://t co/vxiffbao55
I don't understand the meaning of that sentence. Are you accusing the Pope of hypocrisy because he is praying? Or because he doesn't let people into the St. Peter's dome? I don't think you understand what hypocrisy really means.
