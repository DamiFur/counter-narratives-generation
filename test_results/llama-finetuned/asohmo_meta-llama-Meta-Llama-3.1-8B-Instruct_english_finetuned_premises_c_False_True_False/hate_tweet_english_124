@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
A country to walk on, or a piece of land to call home is not the same thing. You know that not all immigrants are created equal, right? Some of them are criminals, some of them are not. You can't generalize.
