@user who care for these children of criminal refugees really they play no role in times of overpopulation
All children play a role in society, no matter where they come from or who their parents are. That role is to exist and be cared for until they are old enough to take care of themselves. If we stop caring for them just because we don't like their parents, we are no better than the ones we criticize.
