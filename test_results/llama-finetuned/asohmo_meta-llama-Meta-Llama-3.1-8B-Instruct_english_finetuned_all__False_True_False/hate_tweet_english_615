@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
It is not true that the laws require asylum to be claimed within a year. In fact, asylum can be claimed at any time, as long as the person is not safe to go back to his or her country.
