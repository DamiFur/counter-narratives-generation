@user @user string him up to show the message that you will pay for your crimes in a country where you are not supposed to be in hashtag buildthatwall we are losing our legal citizens to those who should not be here in the first place if they werent here we would still have our loved ones
We are not going to string anyone up. That's not how things work here. If you don't want to lose "legal" citizens, maybe we can improve the immigration system. Building a wall is a waste of time and money.
