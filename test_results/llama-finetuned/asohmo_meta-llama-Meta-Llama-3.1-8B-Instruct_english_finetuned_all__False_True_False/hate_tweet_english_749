problem for the pm re johnson is that a person who sent round vans telling immigrants to go home is not in a position to lecture anyone on racism the lesson of which is: if you pander theyll take everything you give them and keep pushing for more
I don't see the relationship between racism and "keep pushing for more." In any case, you are talking about people, and you should be aware that no one likes to be treated like an animal to be shepherded...
