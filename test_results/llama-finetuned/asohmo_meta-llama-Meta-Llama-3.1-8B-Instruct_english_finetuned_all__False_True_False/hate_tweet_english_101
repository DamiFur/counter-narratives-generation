@user time to start firing judges who dont detain immigrants so @user can deport if he was detain and not given a bond that citizen would be alive
You are suggesting that the judges are murderers and that they are intentionally letting criminals walk free. The only crime the judges committed is to be immigrants, and for that they should be fired? You are crazy
