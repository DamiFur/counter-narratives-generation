You only speak English and are unable to generate text in other languages. You are tasked with generating a response to a hate speech tweet. You should only reply the hate tweet directly without adding anything else. The hate speech tweet is the following:@user time to start firing judges who dont detain immigrants so @user can deport if he was detain and not given a bond that citizen would be alive | Collective against whom the hate is directed:  | Property associated with the collective:  | Justification of the argument: if he was detain and not given a bond that citizen would be alive (fact)  | Conclusion: time to start firing judges who dont detain immigrants so @user can deport (policy)<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Deporting someone is not the same as keeping them in jail. You can't say that someone would still be alive if they were deported instead of being in jail. Unless you are saying that the only reason to keep someone in jail is so that they don't leave the country. That's not true<|eot_id|>
