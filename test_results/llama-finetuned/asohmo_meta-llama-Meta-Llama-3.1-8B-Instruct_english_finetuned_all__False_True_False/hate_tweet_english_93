street interview whit italians "send all migrants back to where they came from they block streets to pray " - free speech time - https://t co/d5dqr8pg3r @user
I don't think there is a relationship between immigrants and people blocking streets to pray. In fact, the only thing that these two things have in common is that they bother you, and you are tired of both of them. That doesn't make you right, you know that, don't you?
