rich african countries dont take in african migrants rich muslim countries dont take in muslim migrants rich latin american countries dont take it latin migrants but white countries are suppose to accept them ??
Suppose to accept? There is no law that says that countries have to accept immigrants from other places. In any case, it is their decision, and we should respect it... Unless you want to propose a new world order, where you impose your will on the rest of the world. Don't count on me, I'm not going to support that.
