@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
I don't know if you have any idea of the dangers that those people face when they decide to take that boat. You really think that they are just "economic migrants" looking for a better life, but you are not taking into account that they could also be victims of human traffic, or even just really desperate people trying to find a way to escape from hellish situations that you don't know anything about.
