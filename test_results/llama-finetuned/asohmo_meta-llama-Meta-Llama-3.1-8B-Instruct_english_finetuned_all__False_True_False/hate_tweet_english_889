"""@user @user @user it may have to do with plain honest speech so many politicians have the """political speech""" bug theyre accustomed to stating what people want to hear & not what they need to like saying it is hashtag fucktarded to believe the mass hashtag refugee / hashtag rapefugee immigration was good is idiodic"" "
It is not true that all politicians are like that. In fact, most of them are not.Believing that the immigration of refugees is good is not idiotic. It makes sense, refugees are people escaping a war, do you know how inhumane it is to call them "rapists" just because some of them might be?
