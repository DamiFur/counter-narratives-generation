@user @user and meanwhile as they bicker our lettuce strainer of a border sees well dressed and outfitted " refugees " (code for country shoppers ) other illegals and undocumented crossing the border daily https://t co/ghvm5izviu
I don't understand why you try so hard to make us believe that these people are "country shoppers". We all know that they are looking for a better life. Stop making excuses and, if you don't like it, maybe you should move to a country that doesn't allow immigrants.
