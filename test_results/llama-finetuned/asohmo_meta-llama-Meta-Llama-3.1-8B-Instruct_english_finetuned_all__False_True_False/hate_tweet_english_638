ðÿ‡ðÿ‡denmark: ill pay denmark niqab fines: french- algeria n millionaire no go back to algeria better yet tell algeria to open its borders to african migrants instead of europe
I don't understand why you would want to pay those fines. If the state makes bad decisions, it is not our job to pay for them, unless of course, we decide to do it. But in that case, it's our decision, and we should be free to make it.
