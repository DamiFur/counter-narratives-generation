@user a gang of streets sellers ? this is " bbc speak " what u meant to say was third world illegal immigrants hashtag lbc
Why would they be street vendors? Because that's the only thing they know how to do? Because they are the only ones who sell things on the street? You are just trying to insult them by associating them with something menial, when in fact you have no idea what they do or what they are capable of.
