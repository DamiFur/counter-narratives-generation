@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
I don't understand why you would say something like that to a person you don't know anything about. Why would he ask you something like that? what kind of person is he? what is his background? you are just a xenophobe hiding his racism behind a lie of being "talked to"
