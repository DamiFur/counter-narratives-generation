about 3700 refugee medicine doctors are allowed to work in germany in hospitals now they realize that some of them are not on the standard of western medicine and often some buyed the certificats home without knowledge so some patients died https://t co/belfz7m72z
How can you be sure that all refugees who were certified as doctors are not actually doctors? I mean, if they had the opportunity to study and become certified, then they are surely doctors.Maybe the problem lies not in them, but in the certification system you use.
