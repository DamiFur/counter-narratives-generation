for all the people holding up signs regarding illegal immigrants hand them each a bill to pay the cost of how much these people take from the american taxpayer and i bet they would take down their signs and go home
I don't think a bill would convince anyone of anything. Besides, it's not a matter of "how much they take from the American taxpayer", but of their right to migrate....
