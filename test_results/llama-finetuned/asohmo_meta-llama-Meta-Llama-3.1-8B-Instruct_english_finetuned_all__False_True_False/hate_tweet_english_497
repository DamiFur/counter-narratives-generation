@user i just read the guy that broke into many homes including chef jaime oliver was let go but dont call a refugee a rapefugee or the soros sponsored police of the uk will not let you go
I don't think there is a connection between refugees and rape. Most of them, in fact, are not rapists, nor criminals of any kind. They are just people, trying to find a better place to live.
