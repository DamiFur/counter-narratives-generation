"@user if the refugees dont get food and water - they will go back quick here the president havnt to do much "
I don't think you understand how refugees work. They flee their homes for a reason, and that reason is usually war or hunger. If we don't give them food and water they will starve to death. And then you complain that they don't want to go back. Well, of course they don't. Back to war and hunger? No thanks.
