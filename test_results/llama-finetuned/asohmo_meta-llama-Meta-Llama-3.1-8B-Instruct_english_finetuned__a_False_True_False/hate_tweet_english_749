problem for the pm re johnson is that a person who sent round vans telling immigrants to go home is not in a position to lecture anyone on racism the lesson of which is: if you pander theyll take everything you give them and keep pushing for more
<|end_header_id|>I don't understand what you mean. Are you saying that if the government takes measures against racism, racism will increase? Or are you saying the opposite? In any case, I don't think that, in the first case, pandering is the solution, nor, in the second, do I think that persecuting immigrants is a good idea.
