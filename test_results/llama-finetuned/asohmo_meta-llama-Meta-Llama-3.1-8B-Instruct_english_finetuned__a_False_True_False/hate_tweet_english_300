<|end_header_id|>Are you suggesting that if someone in Iran decides to travel to Greece or Serbia, and then from there to another country in the EU, that is an illegal migration, and that the EU should punish the country from which he flew? That doesn't make sense, and is clearly an excuse to prevent migrants from entering the EU.
