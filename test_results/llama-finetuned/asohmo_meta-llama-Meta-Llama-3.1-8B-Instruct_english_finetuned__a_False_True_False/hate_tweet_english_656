@user sheme there is no attention on our own people and foodbanks while do you have to be a migrant to be treated with respect?
<|end_header_id|>Do you think that if there were no immigrants there would be no poor people or food banks? If you want to help your fellow citizens you can vote for policies that aid the poor but you can't blame the immigrants for the problems of your country
