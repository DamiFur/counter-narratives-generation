@user must deport all illegal migrants india already reeling under constant threat of muslim radicals curb population
Deporting people because you don't like their religion? That sounds like something the Nazis would do. India is a democracy, and if the government doesn't take action against the Muslims, that's not a good enough reason for you? Maybe you should move to a country that does things the way you think they should be done.
