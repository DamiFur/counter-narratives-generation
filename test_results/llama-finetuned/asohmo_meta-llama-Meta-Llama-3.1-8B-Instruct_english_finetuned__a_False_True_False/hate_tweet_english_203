@user @user and meanwhile as they bicker our lettuce strainer of a border sees well dressed and outfitted " refugees " (code for country shoppers ) other illegals and undocumented crossing the border daily https://t co/ghvm5izviu
Who is bickering and who is not, doesn't change the fact that there are people trying to cross the border. If you are talking about "country shoppers", you should be talking about how to improve the immigration system, instead of complaining about people who, for whatever reason, decided to fly instead of taking a bus.
