@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
<|end_header_id|>I understand what you are trying to get at, but you are going about it the wrong way. You can't say that immigrants don't have a country just because they are immigrants. That's like saying that anyone who moves to a different city doesn't have a city.
