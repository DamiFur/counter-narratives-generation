@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
<|end_header_id|>Just because they don't stop in Turkey doesn't mean they aren't refugees. Besides, how would you know where they would stop if you didn't catch them in the middle of the sea?
