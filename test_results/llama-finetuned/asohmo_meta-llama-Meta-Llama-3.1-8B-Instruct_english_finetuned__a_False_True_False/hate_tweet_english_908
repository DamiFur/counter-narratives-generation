<|end_header_id|>Just because most of Europe was invaded by Muslims doesn't mean that Italy, Poland, etc. made the right decisions. In fact, it seems that Sweden and Germany are trying to correct the mistakes of those who, instead of promoting coexistence, encouraged the deportation of people who, for some reason, could not assimilate.
