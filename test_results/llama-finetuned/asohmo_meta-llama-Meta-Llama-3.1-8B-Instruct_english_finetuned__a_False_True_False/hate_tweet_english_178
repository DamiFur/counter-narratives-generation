<|end_header_id|>I don't understand how you go from "no blue wave" to "watch out for the red wave". The only thing that makes sense is that you are trying to convince us that the red wave is coming, but it makes no sense for someone who supports Trump to warn us about him, unless, of course, he is setting us up for something...
