@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
Because the law states that asylum can be requested at any time, not that it can only be requested within a certain time frame. In any case, it would make more sense to allow asylum seekers to request it as soon as they arrive, don't you think?
