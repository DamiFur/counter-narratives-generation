It's not true that illegals have no rights. In fact, the SC has established that they have some, but not all, rights. For example, they have the right to an attorney in deportation proceedings, and the government has to treat them humanely. As for education, it's not a constitutional right, but all children, regardless of their immigration status, have a right to a decent education under the 14th Amendment.
