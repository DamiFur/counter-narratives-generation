How do you know that schools are getting extra funding for students who don't speak English well? Maybe it's just your imagination playing tricks on you.And by the way, 44.6% is almost half of the population. It's normal that some people don't speak the language of the country where they live. It's not a big deal, unless you are one of those who believe that everyone should speak your language, otherwise they are not "real" people. That's called xenophobia.
