street interview whit italians "send all migrants back to where they came from they block streets to pray " - free speech time - https://t co/d5dqr8pg3r @user
Who, what, when, where and why? I don't see the link between the Italians you call "racists" and the fact that some streets are blocked by people going to pray. You are just making up excuses for your xenophobia.
