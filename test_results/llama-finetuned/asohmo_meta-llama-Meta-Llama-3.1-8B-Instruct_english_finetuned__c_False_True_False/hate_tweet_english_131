@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
How do you know none of them are refugees? Maybe some of them are, maybe all of them are. You can't know that refugees don't exist, just because you don't see them.
