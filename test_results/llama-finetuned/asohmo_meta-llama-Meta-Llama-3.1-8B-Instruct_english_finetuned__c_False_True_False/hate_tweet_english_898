@user we all know what you mean by scum pal couldnt agree more hashtag sendthemback
I don't think there is a universal meaning for "scum". It's a pejorative term, it always implies that the speaker is on the other side of the scale, morally speaking. I think it's a mistake to use it, because it makes you look like you're trying to make the other guy look bad, instead of making a point.
