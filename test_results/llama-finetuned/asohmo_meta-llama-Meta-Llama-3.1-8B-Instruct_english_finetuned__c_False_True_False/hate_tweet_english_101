@user time to start firing judges who dont detain immigrants so @user can deport if he was detain and not given a bond that citizen would be alive
If you were to review all the cases, you would see that the majority of them are released, not because the judge is pro-immigrant, but because the law states that if the immigrant does not have a criminal record, he/she has the right to a bond and be released.
