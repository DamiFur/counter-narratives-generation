@user @user americas public assistance medicare medicaid ss et al are strained and americans "benefits" are being cut not even able to maintain status quo no immigrants should be granted entry that need assistance hashtag nodaca hashtag norefuge
I don't think cutting people's benefits is the same as not being able to maintain the status quo. In any case, it is not true that immigrants should not be granted entry if they need assistance. In fact, one of the reasons to allow them to enter is to offer them that assistance.
