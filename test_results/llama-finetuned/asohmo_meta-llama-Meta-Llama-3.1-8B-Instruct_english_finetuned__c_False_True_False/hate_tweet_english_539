@user will islam ever be at peace with its self as it goes to war with itsel f no wonder uk people do not accept its refugees
I don't think you understand what "peace" means. Islam is a religion, it is not a country, so it is not possible to go to war with himself. Maybe that's why the Muslims in the UK are accepted so easily? Because they are people, not countries?
