@user cameron is a coward he attacks the poor yet again because of immigration the numbers dont add up we need to get out now
Who are "the poor" and why exactly are they being attacked? By whom? When did all this happen? I think it's just an excuse to get out of numbers that don't add up for you, i.e., you lost the election.
