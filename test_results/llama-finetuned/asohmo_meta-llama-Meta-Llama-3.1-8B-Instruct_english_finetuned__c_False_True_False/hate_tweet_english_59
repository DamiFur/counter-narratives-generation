@user families should not bring their kids into a country illegally would you? we cant afford them hashtag send them home
Of course not, but neither can they afford them. The decision to have children is not a decision that involves money, after all, until they are working they need someone to take care of them, and that someone is going to be someone who already has money, i.e. their parents.
