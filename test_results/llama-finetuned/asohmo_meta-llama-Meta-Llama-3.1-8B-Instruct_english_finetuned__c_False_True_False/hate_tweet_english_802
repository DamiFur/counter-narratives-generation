@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
Do you have any proof that they are not real refugees? Or do you just assume that migrants are not capable of being real refugees? That's called xenophobia
