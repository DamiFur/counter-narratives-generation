I don't think there is any kind of immigrant that is not "illegal" to the eyes of the law. That is why they are called "undocumented".As for the rest, I have no idea why you would say something like that. Is it because you are against immigration? Or maybe because you are xenophobic? I don't know, but I don't think it's a good idea to make up stories about people you don't know just to justify your prejudices.
