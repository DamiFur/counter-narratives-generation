rich african countries dont take in african migrants rich muslim countries dont take in muslim migrants rich latin american countries dont take it latin migrants but white countries are suppose to accept them ??
Just because someone is from a "rich" country does not mean they are willing to accept all the immigrants in the world. In any case, accepting a few million immigrants is not the same as accepting all of them.
