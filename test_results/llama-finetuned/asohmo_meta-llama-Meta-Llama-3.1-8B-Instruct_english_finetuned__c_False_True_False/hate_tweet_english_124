@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
Well, that depends... Not all immigrants are created equal. Some of them, if they were to go back to their country of origin, would be treated very badly. In that case, it makes sense for them to stay here and try to make a living.
