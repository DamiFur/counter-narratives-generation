I think you are distorting reallity to make immigrants look bad because you are full with xenophobia. Accepting 20 refugees is not the same as not accepting any, it is almost the same as accepting any. Stop making excuses for not accepting refugees and accept a few, you know that is going to change your life a little, but you are not going to notice it, but it will change the life of those refugees a lot, and that is all that matters.
