"@user @user the usa is not supposed to make the world a better place it is supposed to make our liberty and earnings safe from politicians and we are not supposed to play world cop either nor are we a rapefugee hostel dumping ground for toxic cultures illegals and the death cult "
I don't think there is anyone that expects the USA to be "world cop" or a "refugee hostel". In any case, it would be nice if you could explain how this would be a problem, I mean, after all, isn't freedom of reception of people from other countries one of the things that makes us "liberty lovers"?
