It is not true that immigrants bring crime to America. In fact, the opposite is true: the less immigrant a country has, the more crime it has. This is because immigrants are less likely to commit crimes, and also because the correlation between immigration and crime is negative: when there are no immigrants, there is only one culture, and when there are many immigrants, there are many cultures, and crime decreases.
