today in tallin: puppets of the financial establishment dream from a new europe with many slaves macron a wordmouth and kern a refugeelover https://t co/yfkd6dsjfm
Who are the puppets? The financial establishment? It sounds like you are talking about the people you do not agree withpolitically, but that is not the same as being a puppet.And why would a Europe with immigrants be a Europe with slaves? That is ridiculous, there is no logical connection between the two.And what is a "refugeelover"? Are you insinuating that caring for refugees is a bad thing? That should not be up for discussion, caring for people in need is a human duty.
