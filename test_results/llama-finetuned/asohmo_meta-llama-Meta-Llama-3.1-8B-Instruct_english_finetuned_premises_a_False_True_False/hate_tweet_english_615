@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
I don't think it's "gaming the system" to take advantage of a system that is unfair. If the problem is that the laws states that asylum can only be claimed within a year of the last arrival, then the problem is with the law, not with the immigrants.
