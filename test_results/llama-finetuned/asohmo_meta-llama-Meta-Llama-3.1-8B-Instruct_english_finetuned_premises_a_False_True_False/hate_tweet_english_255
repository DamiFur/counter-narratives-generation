I don't understand why you would walk away from the democrats. They are the ones who defend the rights of immigrants, and also of the "hardest hit", as you call them. The republicans, on the other hand, have made immigration one of their main issues, and it is clear that they are more concerned about "their" jobs and wages, which, by the way, are not even their own.
