happy hashtag laborday to all legal american workers shame on illegal workers who steal ssn and ids to take hashtag jobs from americans and lower wages hashtag maga hashtag sendthemback hashtag laborday
All workers are equal before the law, no matter if they are legal or not. They have the same rights, and it is not fair to say that someone "steals" a job, or that immigrants "lower wages". You should try to understand that, instead of blaming and discriminating.
