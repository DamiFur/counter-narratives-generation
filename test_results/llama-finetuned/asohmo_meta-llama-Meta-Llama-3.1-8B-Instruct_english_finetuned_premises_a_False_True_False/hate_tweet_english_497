@user i just read the guy that broke into many homes including chef jaime oliver was let go but dont call a refugee a rapefugee or the soros sponsored police of the uk will not let you go
I don't understand, are you asking us to call all refugees rapefugees just because one of them committed a crime? That's not fair to any of them.
