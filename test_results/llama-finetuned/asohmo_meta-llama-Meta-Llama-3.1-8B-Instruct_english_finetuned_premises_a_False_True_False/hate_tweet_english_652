@user " can you think of a place that has been improved by mass immigration or the movements of large numbers of refugees ?" "not one the immigration policies in europe are a disaster youre destroying europe youre destroying the culture√¢
It is not true that Europe is being destroyed, nor is it true that its culture is being destroyed. On the other hand, it is true that, in some cases, refugees have made important contributions. So, it is not a disaster, and you are just a xenophobe.
