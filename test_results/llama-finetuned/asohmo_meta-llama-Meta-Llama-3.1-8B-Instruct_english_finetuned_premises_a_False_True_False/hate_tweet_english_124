@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
I don't see the relation between your story and the question you are asking. You ask about dogs in America or Mexico, but your story is about a country, and you conclude that immigrants don't have a country, which is clearly wrong.
