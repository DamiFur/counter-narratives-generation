@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
You claim to be shocked that people seek better lives, and at the same time you propose to close the door to anyone seeking a better life. The only "disaster" I can think of is the one you would cause to many of them, and to the country you live in, by denying them access to better lives.
