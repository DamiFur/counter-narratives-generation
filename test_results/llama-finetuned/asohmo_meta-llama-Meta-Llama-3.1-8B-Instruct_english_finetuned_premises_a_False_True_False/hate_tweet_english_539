@user will islam ever be at peace with its self as it goes to war with itsel f no wonder uk people do not accept its refugees
Just because Islam is at war with itself (Sunni vs Shia) doesn't mean that its refugees are a problem. Do you realize that, if anything, the UK has even more to offer to these poor people, who have suffered so much because of internal conflicts that have nothing to do with them?
