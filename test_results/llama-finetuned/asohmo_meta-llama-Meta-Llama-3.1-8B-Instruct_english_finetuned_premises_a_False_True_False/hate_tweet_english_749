problem for the pm re johnson is that a person who sent round vans telling immigrants to go home is not in a position to lecture anyone on racism the lesson of which is: if you pander theyll take everything you give them and keep pushing for more
It is not true that if you do something for someone they will ask for more. Neither is it true that immigrants are racists, or that they are the problem. They are just trying to get ahead, as we all would do if we were in their place.
