meanwhile in europe nobody speaks the truth that all of the potential millions of migrants and refugees can not be taken into the euro zone former colonial powers like france &amp britain are not without guilt in the creation of the mess that is most of the african continent today
You say that Europe is to blame for the wars in Africa, and that is true. But that does not mean that we have to accept the consequences of those wars, like an influx of refugees. We can not be blamed for something that happened a long time ago, and at the same time be expected to solve the problems of today.
