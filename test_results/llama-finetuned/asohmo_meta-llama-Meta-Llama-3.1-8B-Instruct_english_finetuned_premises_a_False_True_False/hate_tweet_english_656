@user sheme there is no attention on our own people and foodbanks while do you have to be a migrant to be treated with respect?
I don't understand why you would say that migrants are treated with respect and our people are not. Both, if they need it, will be treated in the same way. Isn't that what bothers you, or are you just trying to complain about something that doesn't bother you at all?
