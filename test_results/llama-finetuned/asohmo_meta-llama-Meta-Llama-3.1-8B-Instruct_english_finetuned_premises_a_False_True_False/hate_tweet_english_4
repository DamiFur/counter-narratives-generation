rich african countries dont take in african migrants rich muslim countries dont take in muslim migrants rich latin american countries dont take it latin migrants but white countries are suppose to accept them ??
Accepting immigrants is not a rich people thing, nor is it a white or black thing. It's a humanitarian thing. We are all equal before the law, and if the law says that immigrants have a right to enter, then they do. If you don't like it, you can change the law, but until then, stop complaining about something that is not your decision, and neither is it in the hands of the rich, or the white, or the black.
