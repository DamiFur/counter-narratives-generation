the real truth is after cologne and in the nordic countries and others no one trusts any refugees a better life for them doesnt mean 1 4 u
I don't understand, you are saying that no one trusts refugees, and then you conclude that they don't have a better life. It seems to me that if no one trusts them, it's because of xenophobia, and if it were true that they have a worse life, it would be because of racism. In any case, it is not something that they have control over, so they are not to blame.
