immigration gone crazy 100 trainee doctors from abroad what about nurse practitioners who are their equivalent get pain peanuts and are trained and come from the uk
Immigration is not crazy just because you don't like the answer. Besides, if you want to complain about someone getting more than you, you can at least try to get the same. You can't complain about getting "peanuts" and then complain that others get more than you. It doesn't make sense.
