A refugee is someone who flees war or social unrest. They are two different things. If someone is fleeing war, they are a refugee. If they are fleeing poverty, they are an economic migrant. It doesn't matter if you call it one way or the other, what matters is that you recognize that they are people in need and you help them.<|eot_id|>
