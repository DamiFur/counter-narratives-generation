@user i just read the guy that broke into many homes including chef jaime oliver was let go but dont call a refugee a rapefugee or the soros sponsored police of the uk will not let you go
Refugees are not rapists, or thieves, or criminals of any kind. Refugees are people escaping from wars and social disasters, people escaping from extreme hunger and people escaping from genocide. Can you imagine? Can you imagine escaping from genocide and arriving at a place where you are treated like a criminal?
