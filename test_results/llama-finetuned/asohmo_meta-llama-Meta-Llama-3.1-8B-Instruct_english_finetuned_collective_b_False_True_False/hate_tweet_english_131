@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
Refugees are people escaping wars or social disasters in their homelands. They are not economic migrants, although some of them might be allowed to work in order to feed themselves. And they are certainly not invaders, or colonisers. They are escaping from being invaded and colonised by other groups, often with the help of foreign powers
