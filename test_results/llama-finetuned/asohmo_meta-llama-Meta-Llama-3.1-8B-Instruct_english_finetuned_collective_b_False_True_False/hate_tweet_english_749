problem for the pm re johnson is that a person who sent round vans telling immigrants to go home is not in a position to lecture anyone on racism the lesson of which is: if you pander theyll take everything you give them and keep pushing for more
I don't know what your problem is, but it seems to me that you are the one who is pushing the immigrants, and then you complain when they "keep asking for more". If you don't want them to ask for more, then maybe you should stop giving them things....
