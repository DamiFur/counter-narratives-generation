@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
Are you saying that there are no real asylum seekers? In that case, I don't see why you would mind if they "invade" your country. Unless what really bothers you is that they are people who are escaping from war and you don't like that they get help
