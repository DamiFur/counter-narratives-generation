@user and this is exactly how it should be in england crime is low in slovakia etc but all the scumbags come to to commit crimes as they know they can get away with it - they never return hashtag stop immigration
 You suggest that crime is lower in Slovakia, but you also suggest that immigrants are criminals. How can it be that crimes rates are lower in a country with more criminals?
