meanwhile in europe nobody speaks the truth that all of the potential millions of migrants and refugees can not be taken into the euro zone former colonial powers like france &amp britain are not without guilt in the creation of the mess that is most of the african continent today
 Nobody claims that all migrants and refugees should be allowed into the Eurozone. The problem is when they stop others from entering, closed the borders, and refuse to take in their share of refugees
