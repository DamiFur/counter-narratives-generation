about 3700 refugee medicine doctors are allowed to work in germany in hospitals now they realize that some of them are not on the standard of western medicine and often some buyed the certificats home without knowledge so some patients died https://t co/belfz7m72z
Refugee doctors are required to pass the same exams as German doctors in order to work in hospitals. If they don't reach the standard, they are not allowed to work as doctors. The problem is not the refugees, but the fact that there are not enough places in the exams for all the doctors that want to take them.
