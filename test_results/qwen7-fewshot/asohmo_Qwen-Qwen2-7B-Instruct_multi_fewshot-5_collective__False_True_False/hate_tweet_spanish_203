The term "refugees" often gets conflated with "country shoppers" or "illegals," but it's important to remember that these are distinct groups with different legal statuses and reasons for crossing borders. "Refugees" are individuals who have been granted protection under international law due to a well-founded fear of persecution in their home country. They have a legitimate claim for asylum based on their personal experiences of danger or harm."Country shoppers," on the other hand, typically refer to individuals who enter a country with the intention of staying illegally, often for economic or other non-protected reasons. Their actions do not fall under the legal definition of seeking asylum.It's crucial to distinguish between these groups to ensure fair treatment and adherence to international law. Let's focus on providing aid and protection to those who truly need it as refugees, while addressing the issues of illegal immigration through proper legal channels and policies.
