It's important to recognize the complexity of migration and its impacts on different societies. Each country faces unique challenges and has the right to manage its borders and assimilation policies according to its needs and values. It's crucial to discuss these issues with empathy and understanding, avoiding oversimplification or stereotyping any group based on the actions of a few. Encouraging integration and dialogue can foster a more inclusive and harmonious society for all.
