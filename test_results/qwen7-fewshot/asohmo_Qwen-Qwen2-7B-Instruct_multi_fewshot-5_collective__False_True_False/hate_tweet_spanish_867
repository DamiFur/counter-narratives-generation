This kind of rhetoric is harmful and divisive. It's important to remember that everyone has the right to seek better living conditions and opportunities, and blaming an entire group of people for the problems of a nation doesn't solve anything. Instead, let's focus on creating inclusive policies that can help lift everyone out of poverty, regardless of where they come from. We're stronger together when we support and empower each other. #compassion #equality #humanrights
