Banning "hate speech" is not inherently linked to an increase in crime. Instead, it serves as a tool to foster a respectful and inclusive society. The issue of mass immigration is complex and multifaceted, involving economic, social, and political factors. Addressing concerns through constructive dialogue and evidence-based policies is more effective than suppressing speech. Let's focus on solutions rather than blame. #UnitedAgainstHate
