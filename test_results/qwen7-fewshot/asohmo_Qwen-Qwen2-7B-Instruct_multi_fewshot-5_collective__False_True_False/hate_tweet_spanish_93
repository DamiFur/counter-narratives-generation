street interview whit italians "send all migrants back to where they came from they block streets to pray " - free speech time - https://t co/d5dqr8pg3r @user
Freedom of speech is a precious right, but it comes with responsibility. When it's used to spread misinformation or incite hatred against specific groups like migrants, it crosses a line. It's important to remember that every person has a story and a right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of where they come from. Let's use our right to speak freely to promote understanding and unity, not division and misunderstanding.
