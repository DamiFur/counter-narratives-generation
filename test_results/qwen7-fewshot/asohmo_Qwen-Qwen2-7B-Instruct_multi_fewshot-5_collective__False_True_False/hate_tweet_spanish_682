It's important to acknowledge and respect the history and sovereignty of Native American lands. The actions of past generations, including the displacement of Native peoples, are a part of our collective history. It's crucial to learn from this history, seek reconciliation, and support the rights and self-determination of Native American communities. Thank you for bringing this forward in your Ted Talk.
