Freedom of speech is a cornerstone of democracy, but so is truth. Let's ensure our discussions are based on facts and respect for all citizens, regardless of their background or political views. Remember, a healthy society thrives on unity and mutual respect, not division and mistruths. Happy Independence Day, and may America continue to be a beacon of hope and freedom for all.
