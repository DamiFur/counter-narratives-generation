Rescueship is a crucial service that saves lives at sea. Sending the lifeline to Malta sends the right signal of solidarity and responsibility towards refugees. NGOs play a vital role in assisting those in need, respecting international law. Jailing the crew would be counterproductive. Instead, let's focus on safe, legal routes for refugees and support those who risk their lives to save others. #RescueNotJail
