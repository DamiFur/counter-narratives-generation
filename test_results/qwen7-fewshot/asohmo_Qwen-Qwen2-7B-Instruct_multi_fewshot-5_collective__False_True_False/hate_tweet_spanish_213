It's concerning to see misinformation being spread about language use in schools and the impact of immigration. Every student, regardless of their language background, deserves equal access to education. Language is a tool for learning, not a barrier. It's important to foster inclusive environments where all students can thrive, regardless of the language they speak at home. Let's focus on solutions that support all students and promote linguistic diversity as a strength, not a weakness.
