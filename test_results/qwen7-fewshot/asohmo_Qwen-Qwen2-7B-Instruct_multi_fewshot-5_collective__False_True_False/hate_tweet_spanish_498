The term "undocumented immigrant" is often used to describe individuals who are present in a country without proper authorization. However, it's important to note that this term can be misleading because it implies that these individuals are simply "missing" documentation, rather than being in a legal status. A more accurate term would be "unauthorized immigrant" or "immigrant without lawful status". Using precise language helps to avoid stigmatization and promotes a more nuanced understanding of immigration issues.
