Respect for human rights and the rule of law is fundamental in any society. Each individual, regardless of their origin, deserves to be treated fairly and justly. If there are concerns about illegal migrants or individuals with expired visas, these should be addressed through proper legal processes, ensuring transparency and fairness. The involvement of a respected judge to oversee such a task is commendable, but it's crucial that this process adheres to international human rights standards and does not infringe upon the rights of any individual. Immediate deportation without due process could lead to serious human rights violations. It's important to balance security concerns with the rights and dignity of all individuals involved.
