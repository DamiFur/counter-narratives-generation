Respecting human rights and the rule of law is a global concern, not a matter of "our business" or "their business." The United Nations plays a crucial role in promoting and protecting human rights worldwide, including the rights of migrants and refugees. Separating families, especially at the border, is a violation of these rights. Constructive dialogue and cooperation, rather than hostility, should be the approach to address such complex issues. Let's advocate for policies that uphold the dignity and rights of all individuals, regardless of their nationality or immigration status.
