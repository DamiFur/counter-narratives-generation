@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
It seems like there's a misunderstanding here. When discussing the rights of immigrants, it's important to remember that every individual, regardless of their origin, has the right to seek a better life in a different country if they choose to. The mention of "dogs" in this context doesn't seem to directly relate to the discussion about rights and immigration. It's crucial to focus on the rights and contributions of all individuals, including immigrants, rather than categorizing them based on nationality or origin.
