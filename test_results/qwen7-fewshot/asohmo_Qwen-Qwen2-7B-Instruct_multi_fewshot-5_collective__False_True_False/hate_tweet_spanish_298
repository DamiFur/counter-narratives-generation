It's concerning to see such statements being made, implying that a desire for a multicultural society is a negative thing or equating it with poverty. Diversity and multiculturalism can enrich societies, fostering understanding and innovation. It's important to remember that every individual has the right to seek safety and a better life, regardless of where they come from. Let's focus on creating inclusive policies that respect human rights and promote peaceful coexistence.
