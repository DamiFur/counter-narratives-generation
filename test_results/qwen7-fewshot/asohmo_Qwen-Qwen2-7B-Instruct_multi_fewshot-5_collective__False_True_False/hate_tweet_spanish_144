It seems like there's a misunderstanding here. The term "sheep" is often used metaphorically to refer to one's followers or congregation in the context of religious leaders. It doesn't make sense to say that refugees are "like sheep" in this context. It appears there might be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the Pope's stance on refugees and the actions of the black Catholic bishops. Pope Francis has been very vocal about his support for refugees and migrants, encouraging the Church to open its doors to those in need. If there are concerns or disagreements, they should be addressed through dialogue and understanding rather than spreading misinformation or hate.
