calais jungle refugees get a grip france they are visitors they have no rights or in a position to demand europe needs to get a grip
Refugees are people in need of protection, not visitors. They have the right to seek asylum and should be treated with dignity and respect. Europe needs to address the root causes of displacement and support countries that are hosting large numbers of refugees. It's important to remember that every person has inherent rights, regardless of their status or where they come from.
