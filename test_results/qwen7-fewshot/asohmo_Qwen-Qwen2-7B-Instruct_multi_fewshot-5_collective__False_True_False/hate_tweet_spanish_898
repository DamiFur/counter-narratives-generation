@user we all know what you mean by scum pal couldnt agree more hashtag sendthemback
Language has the power to unite or divide. When we use terms like "scum" or demand to "send them back," we're not just using words; we're fueling division and misunderstanding. It's important to remember the humanity in every individual, regardless of where they come from. Let's strive for empathy and understanding. #UnityNotDivision
