It's concerning to see rhetoric that promotes division and fear. Let's focus on creating inclusive policies and communities where everyone feels safe and valued, regardless of their background. Building bridges, not walls, fosters understanding and unity. Embracing diversity enriches our societies and strengthens them. Let's celebrate our differences and work together for the common good. #UnityNotWalls
