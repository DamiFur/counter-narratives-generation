The use of children as a means to circumvent legal processes is a serious issue, but it's important to address it with fairness and humanity. We need policies that prioritize the safety and rights of all individuals, including children, while also maintaining the integrity of our legal system. Let's focus on comprehensive immigration reform that addresses the root causes of illegal immigration, provides a pathway to citizenship for those already here, and ensures that our borders are secure. This approach respects the rule of law and promotes the well-being of all communities. #humanitarian #immigrationreform #justicesystem
