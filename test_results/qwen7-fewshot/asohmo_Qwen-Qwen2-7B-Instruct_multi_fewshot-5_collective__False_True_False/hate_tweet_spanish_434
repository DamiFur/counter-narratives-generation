@user who care for these children of criminal refugees really they play no role in times of overpopulation
Caring for children, regardless of their parents' immigration status, is a humanitarian duty. Blaming an entire group of refugees for criminal acts or overpopulation ignores the complexity of migration and fails to address the systemic issues that drive people to seek refuge. It's important to focus on solutions that support integration, address root causes of migration, and ensure the rights and welfare of all children are protected.
