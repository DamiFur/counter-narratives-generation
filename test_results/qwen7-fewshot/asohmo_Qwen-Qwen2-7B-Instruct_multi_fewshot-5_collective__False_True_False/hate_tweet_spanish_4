The concept of seeking refuge and better opportunities is universal and not defined by skin color or religion. People, regardless of their origin, have the right to seek safety and improve their lives. It's important to address the root causes of migration, such as economic disparities and political instability, rather than blaming specific regions for taking in migrants. Every country has a responsibility to uphold international laws and humanitarian principles when dealing with migration.
