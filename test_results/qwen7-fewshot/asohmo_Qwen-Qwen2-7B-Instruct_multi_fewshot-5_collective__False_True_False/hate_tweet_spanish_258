It's commendable that Japan has managed to maintain its country's cleanliness while dealing with refugee situations. Their policy of accepting a limited number of refugees, in this case 20 out of almost 20,000 applications, seems to be a responsible approach. It's important for countries to balance humanitarian obligations with practical considerations and the well-being of their own citizens. This balanced approach can set a positive example for other nations facing similar challenges.
