It's concerning to see misinformation being spread about the financial support given to refugees. It's important to remember that the costs are shared by the German government and taxpayers for the welfare and integration of refugees, not just for them to return home. The aim is to help rebuild and support communities, not to "islamize" Germany. Let's focus on factual information and constructive dialogue.
