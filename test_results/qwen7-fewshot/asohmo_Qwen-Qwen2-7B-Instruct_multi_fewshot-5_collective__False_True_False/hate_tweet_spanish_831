The leaders of a country indeed have a responsibility to ensure the security of their borders. However, it's important to approach such issues with fairness and humanity. Criticism should be constructive and aimed at improving policies rather than stigmatizing entire groups of people. #Orban and #Hungary might be efficient in their actions, but it's crucial that these actions respect human rights and international law, ensuring that migrants are treated with dignity and given fair opportunities. It's about finding a balance between security and compassion.
