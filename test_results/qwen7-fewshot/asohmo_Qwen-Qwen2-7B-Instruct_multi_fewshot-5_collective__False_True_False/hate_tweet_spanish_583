It seems like there's a misunderstanding or a misuse of hashtags related to national pride and immigration concerns. It's important to remember that celebrating one's own culture and heritage doesn't equate to cheering for racial replacement or genocide. Each of us, regardless of our background, contributes to the diversity and richness of a nation. Let's focus on messages of unity, respect, and inclusivity, rather than division or fear. Support for a country's team at a major event like the World Cup should not be conflated with harmful ideologies.
