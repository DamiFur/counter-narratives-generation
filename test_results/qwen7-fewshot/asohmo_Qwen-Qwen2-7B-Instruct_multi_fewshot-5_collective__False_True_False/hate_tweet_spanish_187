It seems like there's a misunderstanding here. When discussing the economic impact of illegal immigration, it's important to consider both the costs and the contributions. While it's true that there might be costs associated with illegal immigration, such as the strain on public services, it's equally important to acknowledge that many immigrants, regardless of their legal status, contribute to the economy by paying taxes, including state and local taxes, even if they are not eligible for federal tax benefits. It's crucial to have a balanced view and consider all aspects of immigration policy.
