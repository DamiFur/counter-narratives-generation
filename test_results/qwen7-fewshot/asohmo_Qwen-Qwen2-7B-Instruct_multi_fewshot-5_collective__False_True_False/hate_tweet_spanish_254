but i thought hashtag white genocide wasnt real? hashtag deportthemigrants hashtag refugees notwelcome hashtag white pride
The concept of "white genocide" is a harmful and false narrative. It's important to remember that all human lives are valuable, regardless of race or ethnicity. Migrants and refugees are people seeking safety and a better future for themselves and their families. It's crucial to promote empathy and understanding, rather than fear and division. Let's focus on building inclusive societies that welcome and support all individuals based on their contributions and needs, not on their skin color or origin.
