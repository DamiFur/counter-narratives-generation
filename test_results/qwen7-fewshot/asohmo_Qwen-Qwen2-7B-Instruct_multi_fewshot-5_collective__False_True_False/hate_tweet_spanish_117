It's important to remember that the responsibility to care for those in need is a global one, not just a local or national one. Countries like the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Kuwait, while they may have different policies on taking in refugees, it doesn't absolve the responsibility of other nations, including the U.S., to assist those who are displaced and in need. The U.S. has a long history of welcoming refugees, and this tradition is rooted in humanitarian values and international law. It's also crucial to address domestic issues such as homelessness and support veterans, but this should not come at the expense of ignoring global humanitarian crises. Let's strive for a balance where we care for our own citizens while also extending a helping hand to those who are truly in need around the world. #compassion #humanity #globalresponsibility
