Misunderstandings and misinformation about organizations like Frontex, NGOs, and the movement of refugees can often lead to harmful narratives. It's crucial to remember that these organizations play a vital role in managing and facilitating the safe and legal entry of refugees into Europe under the guidance of international laws and agreements. Accusations of criminal activity by these entities are not only baseless but can fuel xenophobia and anti-refugee sentiment. It's important to support policies that ensure fair and humane treatment of refugees, based on facts and evidence, rather than on unfounded claims.
