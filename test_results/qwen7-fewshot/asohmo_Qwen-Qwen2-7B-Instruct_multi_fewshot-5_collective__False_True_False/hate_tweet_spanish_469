meanwhile in europe nobody speaks the truth that all of the potential millions of migrants and refugees can not be taken into the euro zone former colonial powers like france &amp britain are not without guilt in the creation of the mess that is most of the african continent today
It's important to acknowledge the complex history of colonialism and its lasting impacts. European nations, including France and the UK, have a responsibility to address the consequences of their actions in Africa. This doesn't absolve the current challenges faced by migrants and refugees, but it does highlight the need for a nuanced and empathetic approach to addressing the root causes of migration. Instead of focusing on blame, we should encourage dialogue and cooperation to find sustainable solutions that respect human rights and dignity.
