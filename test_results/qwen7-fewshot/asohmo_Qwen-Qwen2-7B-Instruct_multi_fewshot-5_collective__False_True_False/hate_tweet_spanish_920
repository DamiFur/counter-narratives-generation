It's important to foster understanding and empathy across borders. Instead of focusing on division, let's highlight the positive aspects of cultural exchange and the benefits of open borders. Showcasing stories of cooperation, integration, and mutual growth can counteract fear and misinformation. Encourage dialogue that promotes unity and respect for diversity. Let's build bridges, not walls. #UnityNotDivision #OpenBorders #CulturalExchange
