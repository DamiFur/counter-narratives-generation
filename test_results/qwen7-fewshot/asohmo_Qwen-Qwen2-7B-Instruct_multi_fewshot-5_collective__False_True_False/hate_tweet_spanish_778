It seems like you're expressing concern about the presence of a certain group in your country and suggesting a strong stance against them. It's important to approach any situation with understanding and fairness. Here's a constructive response:"Respect for all individuals and their rights is a cornerstone of our society. It's crucial to ensure that everyone, regardless of their background, is treated fairly and with dignity.

Let's promote dialogue, education, and understanding to build bridges rather than walls. Together, we can create a more harmonious and equitable society for all."
