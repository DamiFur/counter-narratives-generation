canada is an immigrant country dont change it to refugee country please
Canada prides itself on being a welcoming and diverse country, a place where people from all over the world can come to build a new life. Changing its identity to a "refugee country" would diminish the rich tapestry of cultures and backgrounds that make Canada a unique and vibrant nation. It's important to celebrate and preserve this diversity, which enriches our society in countless ways. Let's continue to welcome immigrants while maintaining the welcoming spirit that has always been at the heart of Canada's identity.
