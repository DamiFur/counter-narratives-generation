It seems like this tweet is suggesting that the country is now safe because immigrants can go home. However, it's important to remember that treating individuals based on their nationality or origin is not a solution to any problem. Every person, regardless of where they come from, has the right to be treated with dignity and respect. It's crucial to address the root causes of why people might feel the need to migrate, rather than focusing on exclusion. Encouraging integration, fair immigration policies, and support systems can help create a safer and more inclusive society for everyone.
