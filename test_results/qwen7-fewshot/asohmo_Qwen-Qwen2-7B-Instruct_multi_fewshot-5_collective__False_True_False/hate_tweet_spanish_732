@user @user @user @user @user @user @user @user @user republican voters will not forgive you for not building the wall hashtag buildthat wall hashtag maga2020
Building walls doesn't solve the complex issues related to immigration. It's important to focus on comprehensive immigration reform that addresses the root causes of migration, promotes family reunification, and provides a pathway to citizenship for those already in the country. This approach respects human dignity and strengthens communities. #ReformNotWalls #MagaWithHeart
