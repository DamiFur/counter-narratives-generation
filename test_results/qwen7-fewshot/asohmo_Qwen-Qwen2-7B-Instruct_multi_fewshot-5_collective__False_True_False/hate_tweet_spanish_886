It's concerning to see such rhetoric directed towards individuals based on their immigration status. It's important to remember that every person, regardless of their legal status, deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. Let's focus on addressing the issues of illegal immigration through fair and humane policies rather than spreading hate and misinformation. Remember, we are all part of a global community, and constructive dialogue can lead to better solutions for everyone involved. #compassion #equality #humanrights
