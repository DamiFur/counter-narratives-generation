@user will islam ever be at peace with its self as it goes to war with itsel f no wonder uk people do not accept its refugees
Peace and harmony within any community, including Islam, require understanding, dialogue, and mutual respect. Misunderstandings and conflicts often arise from lack of communication and exposure to different perspectives. It's important for all communities to foster an environment of peace and understanding, not only for their own benefit but also for the benefit of society as a whole. Let's promote unity and understanding, rather than division and misunderstanding.
