@user sheme there is no attention on our own people and foodbanks while do you have to be a migrant to be treated with respect?
It's disheartening to hear that basic needs like food are not being adequately addressed for your community. Everyone, regardless of their background, deserves respect and access to essential services. It's important to advocate for equal treatment and support for all community members. Let's work together to ensure everyone has access to the basic necessities of life.
