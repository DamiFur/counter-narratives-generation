@user theres an agenda jprdan: white genocide is a crime eu funded report tells journalists not to write negative articles on migrant crisis "it even urges them to report colleagues to the authorities for hate speech crimes "https://t
The notion of "white genocide" is a misrepresentation and a distortion of reality. It's crucial to uphold factual reporting and freedom of speech while also combating hate speech and misinformation. Every individual, regardless of race, deserves fair treatment and accurate representation. Encouraging journalists to report colleagues for "hate speech crimes" under the guise of combating a non-existent threat undermines journalistic integrity and democratic values. Let's focus on factual reporting and constructive dialogue.
