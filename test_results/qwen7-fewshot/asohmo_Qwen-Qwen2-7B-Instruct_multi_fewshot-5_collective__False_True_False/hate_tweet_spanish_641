It seems like there's a misunderstanding here. Aid to countries like Turkey, Libya, Sudan, and others is often aimed at managing migration flows and providing humanitarian assistance, not just to keep refugees away. The goal is to help improve conditions in these countries so that people don't feel the need to migrate to Europe in the first place. This is part of a broader strategy to address the root causes of migration and ensure that assistance is used effectively to benefit the local populations. Concentration camps, unfortunately, are not a part of this strategy and are widely condemned for their inhumane treatment of individuals.
