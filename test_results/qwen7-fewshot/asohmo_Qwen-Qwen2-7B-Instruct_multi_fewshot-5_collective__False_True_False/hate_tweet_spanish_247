Racism and xenophobia have no place in our society. Accusations should be based on evidence, not stereotypes. It's crucial to address the root causes of any issue, rather than unfairly targeting specific groups. Let's promote understanding, dialogue, and respect for all individuals, regardless of their background. #EndRacism #EqualityForAll
