@user and this is exactly how it should be in england crime is low in slovakia etc but all the scumbags come to to commit crimes as they know they can get away with it - they never return hashtag stop immigration
Addressing concerns about crime and immigration is important, but it's crucial to base discussions on facts and evidence rather than stereotypes or generalizations. It's essential to remember that the actions of individuals do not define an entire group or nationality. Instead of labeling all immigrants as "scumbags," it's more productive to focus on policies and programs that support integration, law enforcement, and community safety. This approach helps in creating a fair and inclusive society where all individuals, regardless of their background, can contribute positively.
