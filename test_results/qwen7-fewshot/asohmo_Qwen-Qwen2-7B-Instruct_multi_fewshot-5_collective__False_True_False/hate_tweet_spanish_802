@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
Misunderstanding the plight of migrants often stems from a lack of information and empathy. It's crucial to remember that seeking a better life is a universal human desire, and economic migrants are no exception. They often face significant risks and challenges in their journey, and it's important to address the root causes of migration rather than stigmatizing the individuals themselves. Each person's story is unique and deserves to be heard with understanding and compassion.
