@user @user americas public assistance medicare medicaid ss et al are strained and americans "benefits" are being cut not even able to maintain status quo no immigrants should be granted entry that need assistance hashtag nodaca hashtag norefuge
The strain on public assistance programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security in the Americas doesn't justify denying entry to immigrants who might need assistance. Every person, regardless of their origin, has the right to seek better opportunities and contribute positively to society. Let's focus on improving existing systems rather than limiting access to those in need. #FairImmigration #HelpingHands
