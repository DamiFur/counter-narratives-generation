It's important to remember that everyone, regardless of their origin, deserves equal treatment and opportunities. The conditions you describe seem to be an exaggeration or misrepresentation. It's crucial to base our perceptions on factual information and fair treatment of all individuals, rather than stereotypes or misinformation. Let's strive for fairness and equality for all. #EqualTreatmentForAll
