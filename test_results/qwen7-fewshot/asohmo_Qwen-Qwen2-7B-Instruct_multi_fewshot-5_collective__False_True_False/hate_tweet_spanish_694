@user stop being spineless and tell the eu its our country and stop migrants dictating to us via eu
It's important to address concerns about the impact of migration on a country's culture and identity, but it's equally crucial to do so with respect and accuracy. Instead of labeling migrants as dictators, let's focus on constructive dialogue and finding solutions that benefit everyone involved. This can include improving integration programs, ensuring fair and humane immigration policies, and fostering a welcoming environment that respects the rights and contributions of all individuals, regardless of their origin. This approach helps build stronger, more inclusive societies where everyone feels valued and heard.
