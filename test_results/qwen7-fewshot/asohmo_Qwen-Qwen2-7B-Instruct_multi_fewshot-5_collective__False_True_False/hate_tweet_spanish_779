Governor Cuomo's choice of words reflects strong disapproval and condemnation of the actions of ICE, likening them to "thugs". It's important to understand the context in which such strong language is used, often in response to perceived injustices or excesses by authorities. In this case, the mention of MS-13, known for its violent crimes, and the use of hashtags like 'MAGA', 'KAG', 'POTUS', 'NODACA', 'WALKAWAY', 'NEWS', 'AMERICAFIRST', 'BACKTHEBLUE', and 'ALLLIVESMATTER' suggests a nuanced political stance. These hashtags are commonly associated with various political ideologies and movements in the United States, indicating that Governor Cuomo might be aligning his criticism of ICE with broader political concerns related to immigration policy, law enforcement practices, and social justice.It's crucial to engage in constructive dialogue on these issues, emphasizing the importance of fair and humane treatment of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status, while also acknowledging the complexities and challenges faced by law enforcement in maintaining public safety.
