It's concerning to see such messages circulating. We're all part of the same society, and instead of tearing each other down, we should be working together for the betterment of our communities. Embracing diversity and unity can strengthen our society rather than weakening it. Let's focus on building bridges, not walls, and remember that we're stronger when we support and empower each other. #UnityNotDivision
