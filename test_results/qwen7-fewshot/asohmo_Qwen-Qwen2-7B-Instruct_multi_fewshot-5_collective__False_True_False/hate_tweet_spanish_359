The notion that 'illegals' don't have constitutional rights is a misinterpretation. All people, regardless of their immigration status, are entitled to certain fundamental rights under the Constitution. This includes the right to due process and equal protection under the law. Misinformation like this can lead to unjust policies and actions. It's important to uphold the rights of all individuals, as they are enshrined in the Constitution. #TruthOverMisinfo
