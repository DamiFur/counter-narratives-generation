Sanctuary cities are meant to protect public safety and uphold the Constitution by providing a safe space for immigrants to seek legal assistance without fear of immediate deportation. They do not violate any laws but rather comply with federal immigration laws while also safeguarding the rights and well-being of all community members. Instead of advocating for their shutdown, let's focus on constructive dialogue and policies that support the rule of law while respecting human rights and the dignity of all individuals. #UnityNotDivision #JusticeForAll #LawAndOrder #InclusiveSolutions
