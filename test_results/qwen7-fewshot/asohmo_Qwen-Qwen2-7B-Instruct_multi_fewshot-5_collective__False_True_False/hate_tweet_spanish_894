"@user @user the usa is not supposed to make the world a better place it is supposed to make our liberty and earnings safe from politicians and we are not supposed to play world cop either nor are we a rapefugee hostel dumping ground for toxic cultures illegals and the death cult "
This statement seems to be expressing a particular viewpoint on the role of the United States in the world. It's suggesting that the U.S.'s primary responsibility is to protect the liberty and earnings of its citizens from political influences, rather than to act as a global police force or a haven for refugees. The term "rapefugee" appears to be used in a derogatory manner, implying that the speaker sees the U.S. as a place where toxic cultures, illegal immigrants, and followers of a 'death cult' are unwelcome. It's important to counter this narrative by emphasizing the humanitarian values of the U.S., its commitment to human rights, and its role in providing safety and refuge to those in need, while also addressing any concerns about cultural integration and legal immigration policies constructively.
