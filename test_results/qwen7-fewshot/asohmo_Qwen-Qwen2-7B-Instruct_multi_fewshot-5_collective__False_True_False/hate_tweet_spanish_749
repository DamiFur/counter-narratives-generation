problem for the pm re johnson is that a person who sent round vans telling immigrants to go home is not in a position to lecture anyone on racism the lesson of which is: if you pander theyll take everything you give them and keep pushing for more
The actions of individuals in the past do not necessarily reflect the policies or values of a current leader. It's important to evaluate policies and statements based on their content and intent, rather than associating them with past actions of others. John Johnson's position on immigration and racism should be assessed on the basis of his stated policies and actions, not on the actions of unspecified individuals from the past. This approach helps in maintaining a fair and constructive dialogue on sensitive issues like immigration and equality.
