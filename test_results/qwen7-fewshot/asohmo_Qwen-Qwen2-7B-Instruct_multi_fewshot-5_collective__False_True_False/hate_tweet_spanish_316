@user cameron is a coward he attacks the poor yet again because of immigration the numbers dont add up we need to get out now
Cameron's stance on immigration seems misguided. It's important to consider the impact of policies on all members of society, especially the vulnerable. Transparency and fairness in numbers and their implications are crucial for informed decision-making. It's time for a more inclusive and equitable approach.
