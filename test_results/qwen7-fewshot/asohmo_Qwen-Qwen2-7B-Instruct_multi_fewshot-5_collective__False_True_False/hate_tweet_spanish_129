Refugees, like any other group, seek safety and a better life. Labeling them as 'invaders' or associating them with 'extra crime' is not only misleading but perpetuates harmful stereotypes. Safety and security are universal human needs, and it's important to address the root causes of migration rather than blaming the migrants themselves. Let's focus on creating inclusive policies that protect the rights of all individuals while ensuring the well-being of the communities they join. #welcomerefugees #humanityfirst
