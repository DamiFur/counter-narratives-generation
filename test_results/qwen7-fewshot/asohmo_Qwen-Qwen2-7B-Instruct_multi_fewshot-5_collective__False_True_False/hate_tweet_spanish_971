" spoken like a true globalist a borderless one world government has always been their goal no borders means social mayhem the more chaos they foment the more the public will demand an all powerful superstate ordo ab chao (out of chaos order) is their motto hashtag buildthatwall"
The fear of a borderless, globalist world leading to social mayhem is a common narrative used by those opposed to increased globalization and international cooperation. However, it's important to critically evaluate such statements. Globalism, when implemented ethically and inclusively, can lead to economic growth, cultural exchange, and improved living standards worldwide. The concept of 'ordum ab caos' (order out of chaos) is often misused to justify authoritarian measures under the guise of stability. It's crucial to advocate for policies that ensure fair distribution of resources, protect individual rights, and foster a sense of community within and across borders. The slogan "build that wall" can be seen as a call for isolationism or protectionism, which may not address the root causes of social issues effectively. Instead, promoting dialogue, understanding, and cooperation can help build stronger, more resilient communities globally.
