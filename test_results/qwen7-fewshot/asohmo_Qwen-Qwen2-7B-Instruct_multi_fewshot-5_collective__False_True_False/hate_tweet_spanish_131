@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
Misunderstandings often arise from a lack of clarity. It's important to remember that refugees are individuals or groups who have been forced to leave their homes due to persecution, war, or violence, and they seek protection in another country. Economic migrants, on the other hand, move from one place to another primarily for economic reasons. It's crucial to distinguish between these two groups to foster understanding and support for those in need, while also respecting the rights and laws of host countries. Let's focus on promoting policies that ensure fair treatment and integration for all individuals seeking safety and better opportunities.
