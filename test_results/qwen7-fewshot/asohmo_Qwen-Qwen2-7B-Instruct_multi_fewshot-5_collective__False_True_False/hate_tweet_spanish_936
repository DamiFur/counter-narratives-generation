It seems like you're referring to a series of complex and controversial events related to Hillary Clinton's private email server, allegations of a conspiracy involving the FBI, CIA, and DOJ, claims of perjury, obstruction of justice, and the suggestion of a "silent coup" aimed at removing a U.S. president. This is a highly sensitive and debated topic, often associated with conspiracy theories.If you're looking for factual information or clarification on these events:1. **Hillary Clinton's Email Server**: In 2016, it was revealed that then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had used a private email server for official communications during her tenure as Secretary of State from 2009-2013.

However, there is no widely accepted evidence to support such a conspiracy theory. The FBI has been involved in various high-profile investigations, including those related to the Clinton email server and the investigation into Russian interference
