It's important to address concerns about security and population growth responsibly. However, it's crucial to ensure that these concerns are based on factual information and not on stereotypes or biases. Illegal migration, like any other social issue, should be addressed through comprehensive policies that balance the needs of the country with the rights and dignity of individuals. It's also important to remember that the majority of migrants, regardless of their origin, are seeking safety, opportunity, or a better life for themselves and their families. Let's strive for solutions that are fair, humane, and evidence-based.
