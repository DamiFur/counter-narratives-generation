It's concerning to see misinformation being spread about the impact of illegal immigrants on the political landscape. Every individual, regardless of their immigration status, contributes to the diversity and strength of our society. It's important to base our discussions on facts and respect for all members of our community. Let's focus on constructive dialogue and policies that benefit everyone. #FactOverFear #UnityNotDivision
