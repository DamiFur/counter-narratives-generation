Freedom of speech is indeed a fundamental right, but it's equally important to respect the sentiments of all communities. The outcome of the referendum in Hungary reflects the concerns of a significant portion of the population regarding the impact of immigration on their society. While it's understandable that some might feel offended, it's crucial to engage in constructive dialogue and find solutions that respect diverse viewpoints and cultural sensitivities. It's also important to ensure that such discussions are based on facts and not on stereotypes or misinformation.
