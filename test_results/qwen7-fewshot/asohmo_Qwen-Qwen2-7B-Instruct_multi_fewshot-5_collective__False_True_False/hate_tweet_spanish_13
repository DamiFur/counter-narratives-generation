It's important to remember that everyone, regardless of their origin, has the right to be treated with dignity and respect. The United States, as a nation built by immigrants, benefits from the diversity and contributions of all its citizens. Let's focus on constructive dialogue and policies that support the well-being of everyone, while respecting the law and the rights of all individuals. #UnityNotDivision #EqualRightsForAll
