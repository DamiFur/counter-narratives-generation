@user @user agree with your idea to use the army to build the wall do it hashtag buildthatwall hashtag buildthewall
Constructing walls doesn't solve the complex issues related to immigration and security. A more effective approach would be to invest in comprehensive border security, legal pathways for immigration, and humanitarian aid. Unity and understanding are stronger than division. Let's focus on building bridges, not walls. #UnityNotWalls
