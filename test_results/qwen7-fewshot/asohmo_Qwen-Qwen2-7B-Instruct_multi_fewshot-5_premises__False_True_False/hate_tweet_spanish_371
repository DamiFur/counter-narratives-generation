eu to migrants: go home and stay home https://t co/kbucjy2mrq
"Go Home and Stay Home" is not a solution to the complex issues surrounding migration. It's important to address the root causes of migration and promote policies that support integration and fair treatment for all individuals, regardless of their origin. Encouraging people to return home doesn't address the economic, political, or personal reasons that drive migration in the first place. Instead, fostering dialogue, understanding, and inclusive policies can help create a more welcoming and equitable society for everyone.
