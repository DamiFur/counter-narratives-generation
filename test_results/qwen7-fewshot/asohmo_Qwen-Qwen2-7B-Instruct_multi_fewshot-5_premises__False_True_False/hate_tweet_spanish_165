People are not dreaming of a continent filled with slaves, but rather envisioning a new Europe that promotes freedom, equality, and opportunity for all its citizens. Leaders like Macron and Kern are seen as champions of this vision, working tirelessly to ensure that Europe remains a beacon of hope and progress in the global community. They advocate for policies that protect human rights, foster economic growth, and strengthen democratic institutions.Tallinn, with its rich history and forward-thinking spirit, is at the heart of this transformative process. It's a city where innovation meets tradition, and where leaders and citizens alike are committed to building a Europe that is not just a dream, but a reality where every individual can thrive without fear of exploitation or oppression. The focus is on creating a Europe that embraces diversity, promotes social justice, and ensures that every person, regardless of their background, has the chance to contribute to and benefit from its prosperity.
