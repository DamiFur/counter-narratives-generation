@user guatemala is sending their finest hashtag buildthatwall
It seems like there's a misunderstanding here. Guatemalans using the "#BuildThatWall" hashtag doesn't necessarily mean they are endorsing a policy to build a wall. It could be part of a conversation about various issues related to borders, immigration, or security. It's important to understand the context in which the hashtag is being used before making assumptions about a policy stance. Encouraging dialogue and seeking clarification on the specific reasons behind the use of such a hashtag could lead to a more nuanced understanding of the situation.
