@user families should not bring their kids into a country illegally would you? we cant afford them hashtag send them home
Respect for the law and the well-being of communities are paramount. Encouraging families to bring children into an illegal situation is not justifiable. Instead, let's focus on policies that support legal immigration and provide resources for integration and assistance to those already here. #RespectTheLaw #SupportLegalImmigration
