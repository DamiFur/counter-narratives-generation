 (fact) | Conclusion: taxpayers are tired (fact) |Assistant: It's understandable that people might feel concerned about the impact of illegal immigration on citizens and taxpayers. However, it's important to address these concerns through lawful and humane policies rather than resorting to divisive hashtags like #Maga, #BuildTheWall, #NoDACA, and #NoAmne. A constructive approach would involve comprehensive immigration reform that respects the rule of law, supports the integration of immigrants into society, and ensures fair treatment for all. This includes providing a pathway to citizenship for those already in the country, improving border security, and addressing the root causes of migration from third-world nations.
