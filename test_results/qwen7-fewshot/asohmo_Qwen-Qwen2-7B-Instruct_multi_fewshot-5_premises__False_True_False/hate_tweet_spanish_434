@user who care for these children of criminal refugees really they play no role in times of overpopulation
Caring for children, regardless of their parents' background or legal status, is a fundamental responsibility of society. It's important to focus on providing support and resources to these children, ensuring they have access to education, healthcare, and a safe environment, rather than attributing blame or ignoring their needs based on their parents' circumstances.
