 the invasion (opinion)  | Respuesta: It's concerning to see such divisive rhetoric being spread online. It's important to remember that all individuals, regardless of their political beliefs, have the right to live and contribute to our society. Open borders don't necessarily mean chaos; they can foster diversity and innovation. Let's focus on constructive dialogue and policies that benefit everyone, not just a select few. #UnityNotDivide
