7vqjxjzv | Justificación de la respuesta: el juez afirmó que el gobierno necesita demostrar que consideró los beneficios de tener inmigrantes ilegales aquí trabajando (fact) | Conclusion: los costos de la inmigración ilegal ascienden a 135 mil millones de dólares al año, mientras que los inmigrados ilegales pagan 8 mil millones en impuestos (fact) |Assistant: The judge seems to be emphasizing the need for the government to account for the economic considerations of illegal immigration. He points out that despite the costs associated with illegal immigration, which amount to approximately $1.35 trillion annually, illegal immigrants contribute around $80 billion in taxes. This suggests that illegal immigrants are not a drain on the U.S. economy but rather have some economic benefits. The hashtags #trump and #maga indicate that this discussion is likely in the context of immigration policies under the Trump administration's "Make America Great Again" (MAGA) agenda.
