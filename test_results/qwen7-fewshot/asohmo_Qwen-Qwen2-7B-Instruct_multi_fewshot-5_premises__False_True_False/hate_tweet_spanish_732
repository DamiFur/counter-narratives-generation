@user @user @user @user @user @user @user @user @user republican voters will not forgive you for not building the wall hashtag buildthat wall hashtag maga2020
wall (hashtag)  | Counter-narrative: Building walls doesn't solve the problem of illegal immigration. It's important to focus on comprehensive immigration reform that addresses the root causes of migration and provides a pathway to citizenship for those already living in the country. This approach respects human dignity and promotes a fair and just society for all. #immigrationreform #welcomerefugees #buildbridgesnotwalls
