@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
 rights to a country (fact) | Conclusion: meaning ours (fact) | Counter-narrative: Immigrants, regardless of their origin, have the right to seek a better life in any country they choose. This is a fundamental aspect of global mobility and human rights. The idea that one country has exclusive rights over immigrants is a misunderstanding of international law and human rights principles. Every individual has the right to migrate in search of opportunities, safety, and a better quality of life, whether they come from America, Mexico, or any other part of the world. It's important to recognize and respect these rights, fostering a global community that values diversity and inclusivity. |
