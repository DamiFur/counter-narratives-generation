@user a gang of streets sellers ? this is " bbc speak " what u meant to say was third world illegal immigrants hashtag lbc
<|im_start|>AssistantMisunderstandings can happen, but it's important to be precise. When someone refers to "a gang of street sellers," they might indeed be speaking in a way that aligns with BBC's formal tone. However, it's crucial to avoid stigmatizing entire groups based on the actions of a few. The term "third world illegal immigrants" can be misleading and insensitive, as it doesn't differentiate between legal and illegal status, nor does it account for the cultural, economic, and social diversity within such groups. It's better to describe individuals based on their actions or characteristics rather than their nationality or legal status. Let's strive for clarity and respect in our communications.
