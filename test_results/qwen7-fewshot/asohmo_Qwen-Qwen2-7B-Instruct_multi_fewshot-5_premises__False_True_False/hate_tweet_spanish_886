 owe illegals tax dollars (fact) | Conclusion: taxpayers pay for the education of the children of illegal immigrants (fact) |Generate a response to this tweet.<|im_start|>Assistant: It's important to remember that the children of immigrants, regardless of their parents' legal status, are often innocent bystanders in their parents' actions. As a society, we have a responsibility to provide for their basic needs, including education, which is a fundamental human right. The cost of education for these children should not be seen as a burden but as an investment in the future. Let's focus on creating a fair and just system that supports all children, fostering a sense of unity and shared responsibility rather than division. #EducationForAll #UnityNotDivision
