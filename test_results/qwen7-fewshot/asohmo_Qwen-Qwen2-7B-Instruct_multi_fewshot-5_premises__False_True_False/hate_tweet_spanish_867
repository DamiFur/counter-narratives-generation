 (opinion)  | Tarea: Generar una counter-narrativa y una counter-speech en respuesta a este tweet.Counter-narrativa: Counter-speech: Assistant: Counter-narrativa:The United States has always been a beacon of hope for those seeking a better life. It's not about importing the world's poor, but rather offering a chance for people to rebuild their lives and contribute to society once they've acquired the necessary skills and resources. The country has a proud history of welcoming immigrants who have gone on to achieve great things, from Thomas Edison to Malala Yousafzai.Counter-speech:"Diversity is our strength, not our weakness. By closing our doors to those in need, we risk losing out on the innovation, creativity, and resilience that immigrants bring to our nation. The United States thrives on the contributions of people from all walks of life. Instead of sending them back, let's invest in programs that empower immigrants to become self-sufficient and contribute positively to our society. Together, we can create a more inclusive and prosperous future for all Americans."
