ag (fact) | Conclusion: come to england to commit crimes, they never return (fact) |Assistant: It's important to understand that crime rates and immigration policies are complex issues influenced by many factors. Labeling entire groups of people as "scumbags" and suggesting they come to a country to commit crimes without evidence is not only unfair but also perpetuates harmful stereotypes. It's crucial to base discussions on facts and data rather than assumptions or generalizations. Encouraging open dialogue and evidence-based analysis can lead to more effective policies and a better understanding of the issues at hand.
