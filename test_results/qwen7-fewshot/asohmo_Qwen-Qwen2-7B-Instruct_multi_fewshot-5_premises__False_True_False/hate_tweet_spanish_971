 borders (fact) | Conclusion: social mayhem (fact) |Assistant: Borderless systems can lead to a sense of loss of identity and control for some individuals and communities, which might contribute to feelings of social instability or mayhem.

Constructive dialogue and inclusive policies can help mitigate potential issues and foster a sense of unity rather than division.
