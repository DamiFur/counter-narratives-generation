@user stop being spineless and tell the eu its our country and stop migrants dictating to us via eu
Standing up for your beliefs doesn't make you spineless. It's important to assert your country's sovereignty while also advocating for fair and humane immigration policies that respect the rights of all individuals. Dialogue and understanding can lead to better outcomes for everyone involved.
