 fact that they are illegal (fact) | Conclusion: shut them down, arrest and prosecute criminal governors and mayors (fact) |Counter-narrative:Sanctuary cities exist to protect vulnerable communities from the overreach of federal immigration policies. These policies often lead to the unjust detention and deportation of individuals who have lived in the country for years, contributing positively to their communities. Instead of shutting them down, we should focus on reforming immigration policies to ensure they are fair, humane, and uphold the principles of justice and equality. This includes providing a pathway to citizenship for those who are currently living in the country without legal status, and ensuring that all individuals, regardless of their immigration status, have access to essential services like healthcare, education, and protection under the law. Let's work towards comprehensive immigration reform that respects the rights of all people, regardless of where they were born or how they came to be in the United States.
