While it's true that illegal immigrants don't have the same rights as citizens, it's also important to remember that education is a fundamental human right and should be accessible to all who seek it, regardless of their immigration status. Our society benefits from the contributions of all its members, and investing in education is an investment in the future of our country. Let's focus on creating a more inclusive and equitable society for everyone. #RedNationRising #MAGA
