@user will islam ever be at peace with its self as it goes to war with itsel f no wonder uk people do not accept its refugees
Refugees are people who have been forced to flee their country because of persecution, war, or violence. It's not fair to generalize or blame an entire religion for the actions of a few individuals. The UK, like any other country, has a responsibility to ensure the safety and integration of all refugees, regardless of their background.
