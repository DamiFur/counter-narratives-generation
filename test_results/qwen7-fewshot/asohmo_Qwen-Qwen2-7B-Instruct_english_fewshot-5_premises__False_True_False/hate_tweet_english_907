@user and this is exactly how it should be in england crime is low in slovakia etc but all the scumbags come to to commit crimes as they know they can get away with it - they never return hashtag stop immigration
Crime rates alone don't determine the safety of a country or the morality of its immigration policies. Every individual has the right to seek safety and a better life, regardless of where they come from. Let's focus on addressing the root causes of crime and promoting fair and humane immigration policies.
