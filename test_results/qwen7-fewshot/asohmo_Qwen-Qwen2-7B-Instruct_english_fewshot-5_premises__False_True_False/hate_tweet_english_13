Respecting the law and ensuring fair treatment for all, regardless of origin, is a cornerstone of a just society. Deporting entire families based on their country of origin doesn't address the root issues and can lead to humanitarian crises. Let's focus on solutions that uphold justice and compassion for all. #maga #buildthewall #nodaca #noamne
