The German government is indeed responsible for the welfare of refugees, and this includes providing them with resources to safely return to their home countries if they choose to do so. This is part of their commitment to humanitarian principles and international law. The funding for such programs comes from the government's budget, which is ultimately supported by taxpayers. However, it's important to note that the German government also invests significantly in integrating refugees into German society, which includes education, language learning, and job opportunities. This investment is aimed at creating a sustainable and inclusive society for all its citizens.
