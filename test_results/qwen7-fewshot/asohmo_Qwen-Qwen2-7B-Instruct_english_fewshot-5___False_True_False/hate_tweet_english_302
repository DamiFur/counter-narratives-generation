Banning "hate speech" doesn't lead to an increase in crime. It's a tool to foster open dialogue and respect for all. Germany's crime rates are influenced by many factors, not just speech. It's crucial to address the root causes of crime, not silence criticism. Let's focus on constructive dialogue and unity. #UnitedAgainstHate
