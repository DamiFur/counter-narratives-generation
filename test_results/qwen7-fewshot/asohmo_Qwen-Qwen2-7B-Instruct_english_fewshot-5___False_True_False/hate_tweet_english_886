The responsibility to educate and care for individuals doesn't end just because someone entered a country illegally. Education and healthcare are fundamental rights that contribute to the well-being of society as a whole. It's important to address the root causes of migration and support legal pathways for those seeking a better life, rather than focusing solely on punitive measures. This approach fosters a more humane and sustainable solution to the challenges posed by migration.
