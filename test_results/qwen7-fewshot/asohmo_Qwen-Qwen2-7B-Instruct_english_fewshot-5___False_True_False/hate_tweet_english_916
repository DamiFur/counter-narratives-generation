Labor Day is about celebrating all workers who contribute to our society. It's important to remember that immigrants, whether legal or not, play a significant role in our economy and communities. Focusing on the contributions of all workers, regardless of their immigration status, helps build a stronger, more inclusive society. Let's celebrate diversity and the spirit of hard work on Labor Day. #Maga #CelebrateAllWorkers
