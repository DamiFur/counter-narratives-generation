"""@user @user @user it may have to do with plain honest speech so many politicians have the """political speech""" bug theyre accustomed to stating what people want to hear & not what they need to like saying it is hashtag fucktarded to believe the mass hashtag refugee / hashtag rapefugee immigration was good is idiodic"" "
It's commendable when leaders speak truthfully. Honesty can lead to better understanding and more effective solutions. Politicians should aim to say what needs to be said, not just what's popular. This fosters a more informed and responsible society.
