regardless of intent the term " undocumented immigrant " is incorrect because illegal aliens are foreigners (i e aliens ) who are unlawfully present in the united states (i e illegal) https://t co/aarjtduwya https://t co/hkrv7mpzok
The term "undocumented immigrant" is often used to describe individuals who are in the U.S. without proper documentation. While "illegal aliens" emphasizes the unlawful status, it can be seen as more pejorative. The distinction is important, but the focus should be on addressing the situation legally and humanely, not on the terminology used.
