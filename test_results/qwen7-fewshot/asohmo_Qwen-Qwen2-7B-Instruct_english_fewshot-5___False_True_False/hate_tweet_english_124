@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
The right to migrate is based on the right to choose your country of origin. If someone is an immigrant, it means they have chosen a country other than their own. This doesn't mean they don't have rights, but it does mean they are part of a new community with its own set of rules and values.
