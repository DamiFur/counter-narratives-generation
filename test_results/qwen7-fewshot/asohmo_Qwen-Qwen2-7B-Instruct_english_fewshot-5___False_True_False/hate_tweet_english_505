Kate Steinle's death is indeed a tragic event, and it's important to remember her. However, it's crucial to discuss immigration policies with empathy and accuracy. Blaming all immigrants for the actions of a few doesn't help in finding a solution. Let's focus on comprehensive immigration reform that addresses the root causes of illegal immigration and ensures the safety of all communities.#KateSteinle #ImmigrationReform #CompassionNotBlame
