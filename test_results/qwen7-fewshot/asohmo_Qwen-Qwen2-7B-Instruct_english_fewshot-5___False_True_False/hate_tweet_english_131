@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
It's important to distinguish between those seeking refuge and economic migrants. Let's focus on creating policies that protect the vulnerable while also considering the economic impact on host countries. Dialogue and understanding can lead to better solutions for everyone involved.
