It's true that each country has its own resources and priorities. However, it's also important to remember that the U.S. has a long history of welcoming refugees, and many Americans believe in the moral obligation to help those in need, regardless of where they come from. It's also worth noting that the cost of supporting refugees is often offset by the contributions they make to the economy and society once they are able to work and become self-sufficient. It's a complex issue, but it's important to approach it with empathy and understanding for all involved.
