It's important to address the root causes of migration and work with countries like Serbia to ensure they have the support they need to manage their borders effectively. Sanctions should be a tool of last resort, used to encourage positive change when diplomatic efforts have failed. Let's focus on constructive dialogue and cooperation to find solutions that benefit everyone involved.
