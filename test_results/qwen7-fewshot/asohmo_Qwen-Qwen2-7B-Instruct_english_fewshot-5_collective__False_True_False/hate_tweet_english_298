Orban's stance on refugees is a reflection of his broader vision for Eastern Europe. It's important to understand that cultural diversity can enrich societies, not impoverish them. The goal of creating a multicultural Europe is to foster unity and respect among different cultures, not to create division. It's crucial for leaders to consider the well-being of all citizens, not just a select few, when making decisions about immigration and cultural integration.
