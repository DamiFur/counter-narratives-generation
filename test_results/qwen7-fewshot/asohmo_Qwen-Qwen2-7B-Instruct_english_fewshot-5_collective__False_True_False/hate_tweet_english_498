"Undocumented immigrant" is a term used to describe someone who is in a country without proper authorization. It doesn't necessarily carry the same negative connotations as "illegal alien," which has historically been used in a more pejorative way. It's important to use language that respects and acknowledges the legal status and human rights of all individuals.
