Respecting the rule of law and the rights of all individuals, including those seeking refuge, is a cornerstone of any just society. India, like all nations, has the right to control its borders, but this must be done within the framework of international law and humanitarian principles. It's important to address the root causes of migration and to ensure that any actions taken are fair and just for all concerned.
