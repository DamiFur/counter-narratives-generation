for all the people holding up signs regarding illegal immigrants hand them each a bill to pay the cost of how much these people take from the american taxpayer and i bet they would take down their signs and go home
This approach doesn't address the root causes of why people migrate illegally. It also doesn't acknowledge the contributions these individuals might make to society and the economy. A more constructive approach would be to focus on legal pathways for immigration and comprehensive immigration reform that respects human dignity and addresses the needs of both immigrants and the country they choose to call home.
