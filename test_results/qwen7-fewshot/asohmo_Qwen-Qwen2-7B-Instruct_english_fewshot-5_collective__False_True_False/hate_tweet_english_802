@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
It's understandable to be concerned about the influx of migrants, but conflating economic migrants with refugees and assuming everyone's intentions are solely for welfare benefits might not be fair. Many people seek a better life and safety, not just benefits. It's important to address the root causes of migration and provide humanitarian assistance where needed.
