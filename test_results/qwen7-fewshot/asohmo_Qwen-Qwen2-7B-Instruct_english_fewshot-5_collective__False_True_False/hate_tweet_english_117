It's understandable to be concerned about the welfare of your own country and its citizens. However, it's also important to consider the humanitarian aspect of helping those in need, especially when it comes to refugees. Many nations, including the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Kuwait, have their own reasons for not accepting refugees, which might not be directly comparable to the situation in the U.S. It's crucial to address the needs of homeless citizens within our own borders while also considering the global responsibility towards those fleeing war, persecution, or disaster. It's a complex issue that involves balancing domestic needs with international obligations.
