It's important to remember that the legal system is designed to be fair for everyone. Deportations and asylum claims are complex processes that should be handled with fairness and justice for all involved. It's crucial to ensure that everyone, regardless of their immigration status, has access to fair treatment under the law. Let's focus on constructive dialogue and solutions that respect human rights and the rule of law.
