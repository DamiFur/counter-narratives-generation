Governor Cuomo's choice of words is a reflection of his strong stance against the actions of any group, including ICE, when they are perceived to be acting inappropriately. It's important to hold all entities accountable for their actions, regardless of their role in society. Let's focus on constructive dialogue and policies that benefit everyone. #Americafirst #AllLivesMatter
