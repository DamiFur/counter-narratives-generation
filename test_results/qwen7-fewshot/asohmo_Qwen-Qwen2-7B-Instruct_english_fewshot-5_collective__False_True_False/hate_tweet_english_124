@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
Dogs are universal and belong to no one country. It's important to remember that immigrants are people seeking a better life, just like anyone else, and should be treated with respect and dignity.
