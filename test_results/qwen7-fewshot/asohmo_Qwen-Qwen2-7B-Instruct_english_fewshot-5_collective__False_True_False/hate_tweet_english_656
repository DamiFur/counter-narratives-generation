@user sheme there is no attention on our own people and foodbanks while do you have to be a migrant to be treated with respect?
Respect isn't earned based on nationality. Everyone, regardless of where they come from, deserves basic human dignity and fair treatment. Let's focus on helping all those in need, not dividing them by where they were born.
