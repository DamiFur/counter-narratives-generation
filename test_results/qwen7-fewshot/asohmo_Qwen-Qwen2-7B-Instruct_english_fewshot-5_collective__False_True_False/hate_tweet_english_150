The Democratic Party's stance on immigration reform aims to provide a path to citizenship for undocumented individuals who have lived in the U.S. for a significant period of time. They believe in respecting the contributions of immigrants to our society and economy, while also addressing the need for secure borders and a fair legal immigration system. It's important to focus on comprehensive immigration reform that includes a pathway to citizenship, family reunification, and protection for Dreamers, without resorting to divisive rhetoric or policies that undermine the dignity and rights of all people. This approach aligns with the principles of fairness, justice, and the American Dream.
