" the ngo rescueship lifeline will now go to malta this is the wrong signal for all the humancatcher from the ngos the crew should send into jail because the have ignored the law and the refugees should be brought back to libya https://t co/hp1yvydepf"
Rescuing people in distress at sea is a humanitarian duty, not a crime. Jailing those who do this work misunderstands the complexity of migration and the challenges faced by refugees. Let's focus on solutions that respect human rights and international law. #RescueNotJail
