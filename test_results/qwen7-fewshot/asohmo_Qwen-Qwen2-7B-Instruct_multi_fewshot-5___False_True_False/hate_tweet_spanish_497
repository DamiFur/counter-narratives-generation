It's concerning to hear about such incidents, but it's crucial to ensure that justice is applied fairly and impartially to all individuals, regardless of their background. Labeling someone based on their nationality or refugee status does not contribute to a fair and just society. It's important to handle each case based on the evidence and the law, ensuring that everyone is treated equally under the law.
