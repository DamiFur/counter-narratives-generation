Respect for all individuals, regardless of their origin, is a fundamental human right. India, like any other nation, has the right to control its borders and ensure the legal status of its residents. However, it's crucial to handle such matters with fairness, compassion, and in accordance with international law. Let's ensure that every action taken respects the dignity and rights of all individuals, fostering a society that is inclusive and just for everyone.
