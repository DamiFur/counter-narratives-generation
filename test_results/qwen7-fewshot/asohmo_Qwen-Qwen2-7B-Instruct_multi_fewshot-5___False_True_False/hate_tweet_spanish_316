@user cameron is a coward he attacks the poor yet again because of immigration the numbers dont add up we need to get out now
@user, it's concerning to hear that you're feeling this way. Cameron's stance on immigration might seem tough, but it's important to consider all sides and the impact on society. It's crucial for leaders to address the needs of the poor while also managing immigration to ensure fair policies. Let's focus on constructive dialogue and seek solutions that benefit everyone. How can we work towards a more inclusive and supportive approach to immigration?
