It seems like you're expressing concern over the use of certain hashtags that might be associated with messages of racial replacement or genocide. It's important to remember that every individual has the right to support their national team and express pride in their own culture and heritage. However, it's equally important to ensure that these expressions do not lead to harmful, discriminatory, or violent actions against any group, including the French people or any other ethnic group.Supporting your team at a sporting event is a positive way to celebrate culture and unity. It's crucial, though, to maintain respect and inclusivity in these celebrations. Encouraging dialogue and understanding among different communities can help prevent misunderstandings and promote peaceful coexistence.If you're referring to a specific situation or event, it would be helpful to have more context to provide a more detailed response. However, in general, it's important to promote messages of unity, diversity, and respect for all individuals regardless of their race, ethnicity, or nationality.
