Governor Cuomo's choice of words reflects strong disapproval and condemnation of the actions of ICE, likening them to "thugs." This is a powerful statement that emphasizes the severity of the criticism. It's important to note that such strong language is typically reserved for the most extreme actions or entities. By comparing ICE to thugs, Cuomo is likely trying to draw attention to what he perceives as excessive or unjustified actions by the agency. This kind of rhetoric can be influential in shaping public opinion and policy discussions around immigration and law enforcement. It's crucial for all stakeholders to engage in respectful and constructive dialogue to address the complexities of these issues.
