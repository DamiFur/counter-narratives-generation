@user " can you think of a place that has been improved by mass immigration or the movements of large numbers of refugees ?" "not one the immigration policies in europe are a disaster youre destroying europe youre destroying the culture√¢
Improvements in a society often come from the diverse contributions of its members, regardless of their origin. Consider the United States, which has thrived on waves of immigration, enriching its culture, economy, and society with new ideas, skills, and perspectives. Europe, too, has a rich history of benefiting from migration, from the Roman Empire to the more recent influx of people seeking better opportunities or safety. It's important to focus on policies that ensure integration, respect for all, and the preservation of cultural values while benefiting from the diversity that migration can bring.
