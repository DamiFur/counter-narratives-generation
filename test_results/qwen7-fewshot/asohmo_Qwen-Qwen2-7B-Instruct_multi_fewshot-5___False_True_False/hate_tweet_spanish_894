Freedom and prosperity within our borders are indeed paramount. However, it's equally important to foster global stability and human rights. The U.S.'s role isn't just about self-preservation; it's also about contributing to a world where liberty and justice are universal values. This doesn't mean the U.S. should act as a 'world cop', but it should engage in diplomacy and aid where it can promote these values without infringing on sovereignty or imposing harmful ideologies.
