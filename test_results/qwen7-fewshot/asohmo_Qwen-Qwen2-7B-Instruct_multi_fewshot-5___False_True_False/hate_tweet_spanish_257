The statistics you've mentioned suggest that a significant portion of those arrested from MS-13 gangs are unaccompanied minor immigrants. It's important to address the root causes of gang involvement and migration, focusing on comprehensive immigration policies that prioritize family reunification, education, and economic opportunities in their home countries. Simultaneously, enforcing laws and ensuring public safety is crucial. A balanced approach that addresses both the needs of immigrants and the security concerns of the community can help in creating a more harmonious and safer society for everyone.
