Addressing the issue of refugees is complex and multifaceted. It's important to consider not just the financial cost, but also the humanitarian responsibility and the potential benefits to a country's society and economy. Every nation has the right to prioritize its citizens' needs, including those of the homeless and veterans. It's crucial to find a balance that respects international obligations and supports vulnerable populations, while also considering domestic needs. It's also important to foster a dialogue that promotes empathy and understanding, rather than division and exclusion. #RefugeeSupport #GlobalResponsibility
