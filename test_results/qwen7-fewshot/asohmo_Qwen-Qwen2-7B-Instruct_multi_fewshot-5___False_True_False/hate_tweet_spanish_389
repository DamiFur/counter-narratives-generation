Respecting the law and upholding the Constitution is paramount. Sanctuary cities serve a crucial role in protecting vulnerable communities and ensuring fair treatment under the law. Instead of advocating for their shutdown, let's focus on constructive dialogue and finding solutions that respect everyone's rights and the rule of law. #UnityOverDivision #LawAndOrder #CivilityInPolitics
