Respect for all individuals regardless of their nationality or immigration status is a cornerstone of a just society. It's important to remember that every person has the right to seek safety and a better future for themselves and their families. Criminal activity isn't determined by a person's legal status but by their actions. Let's focus on constructive dialogue and policies that respect human rights and promote the well-being of all communities. #UnityNotDivision #EmpathyOverExclusion
