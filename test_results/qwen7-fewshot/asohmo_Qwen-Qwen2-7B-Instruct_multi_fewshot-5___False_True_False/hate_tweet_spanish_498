The term "undocumented immigrant" is often used to describe individuals who are in a country without the proper legal documentation, but who may or may not be in the country illegally. It's important to recognize the distinction between being undocumented and being illegal, as the former refers to a legal status while the latter refers to a violation of immigration laws. Both terms can be sensitive, so it's crucial to use language that respects all parties involved and promotes clarity and accuracy.
