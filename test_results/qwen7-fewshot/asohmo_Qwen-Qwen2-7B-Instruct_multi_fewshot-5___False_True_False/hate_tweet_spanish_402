The actions of organizations like Frontex are crucial in managing migration flows and ensuring safety at borders. It's important to remember that NGOs play a vital role in providing aid and support to refugees. Accusations without evidence can be misleading and harmful. It's crucial for transparency and accountability in all operations related to refugee management.
