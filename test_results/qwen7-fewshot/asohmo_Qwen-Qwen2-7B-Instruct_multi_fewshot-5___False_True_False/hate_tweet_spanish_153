It's concerning when there's a perception that certain groups are treated differently under the law or in society. It's important to remember that every individual, regardless of their background, deserves equal treatment and opportunities. The focus should be on improving conditions for all, not creating divisions. Let's aim for inclusive policies and practices that benefit everyone in our society. #EqualityForAll
