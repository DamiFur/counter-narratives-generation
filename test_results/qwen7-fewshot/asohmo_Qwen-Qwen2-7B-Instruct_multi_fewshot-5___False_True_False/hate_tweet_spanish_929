@user @user string him up to show the message that you will pay for your crimes in a country where you are not supposed to be in hashtag buildthatwall we are losing our legal citizens to those who should not be here in the first place if they werent here we would still have our loved ones
Your concern for the safety and rights of legal citizens is understandable. However, let's focus on constructive dialogue and solutions. Instead of labeling entire groups based on the actions of a few, let's advocate for comprehensive immigration policies that ensure security while respecting human rights. Building walls doesn't solve the underlying issues; fostering understanding and cooperation does. Let's use our voices to promote unity and respect for all people, regardless of their origin. #BuildTogetherNotWalls
