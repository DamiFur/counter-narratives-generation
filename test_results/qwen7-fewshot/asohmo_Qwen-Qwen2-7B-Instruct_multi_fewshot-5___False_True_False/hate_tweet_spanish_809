It seems like there's a misunderstanding here. Setting a refugee admissions cap is a policy decision made by a government, aiming to manage the number of refugees entering the country annually. The implication of reducing this number to just 5,000 would indeed affect the budgets of organizations that assist with resettlement. These organizations typically receive funding from the government to help refugees integrate into their new communities. The nine "supposed charities" mentioned likely refer to these resettlement contractors. It's important to discuss such policies openly and factually, focusing on the humanitarian needs and the practical implications for these organizations and the refugees they support.
