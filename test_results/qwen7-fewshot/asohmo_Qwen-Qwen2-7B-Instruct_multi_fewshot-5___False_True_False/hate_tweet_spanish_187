The idea that illegal immigration costs significantly more than it benefits the U.S economy is a common point of discussion. However, it's crucial to understand that the cost-benefit analysis is complex and multifaceted. While it's true that illegal immigrants might not pay all taxes legally, they often contribute to the economy in other ways, such as spending in local markets and paying for services like education and healthcare. It's important to consider the full spectrum of economic contributions and societal impacts when discussing immigration policies.
