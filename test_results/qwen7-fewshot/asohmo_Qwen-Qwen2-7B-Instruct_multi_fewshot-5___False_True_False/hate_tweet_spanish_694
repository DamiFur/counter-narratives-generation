@user stop being spineless and tell the eu its our country and stop migrants dictating to us via eu
Dear @user, it's important to stand firm with respect and responsibility. Europe is indeed a shared space for all its citizens. Let's focus on inclusive policies that protect everyone's rights while managing migration effectively. Dialogue and understanding are key to creating a harmonious society for all.
