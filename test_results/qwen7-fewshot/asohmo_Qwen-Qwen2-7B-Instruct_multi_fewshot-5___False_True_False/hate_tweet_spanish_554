It's concerning to see misinformation being spread about the number of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. and their supposed impact on political representation. The idea that 15 million illegal immigrants sway the balance of power in Congress by 20 seats in blue states is not supported by factual data. It's important to base our discussions and policies on accurate information. Let's focus on constructive dialogue and evidence-based solutions. #FactCheck #TruthMatters
