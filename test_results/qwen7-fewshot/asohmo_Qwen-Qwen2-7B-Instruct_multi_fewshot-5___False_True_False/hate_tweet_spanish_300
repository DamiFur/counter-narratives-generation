Addressing the issue of illegal migration is important, but it's crucial to approach it with fairness and understanding. Granting visas shouldn't be reckless; instead, it should be part of a well-structured immigration policy. Sanctions should be a measure of last resort, after all diplomatic and humanitarian efforts have been exhausted. It's essential to tackle the root causes of migration and ensure that any measures taken are just and humane.
