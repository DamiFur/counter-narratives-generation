canada is an immigrant country dont change it to refugee country please
Canada prides itself on being a country that values diversity and inclusivity. Changing its identity from an "immigrant country" to a "refugee country" would be a misrepresentation of its rich history and ongoing commitment to welcoming people from all walks of life who seek a better future. Canada continues to be a beacon of hope for those fleeing persecution and conflict, while also actively encouraging skilled immigrants to contribute to its economy and society. It's important to celebrate and maintain this balance, ensuring that Canada remains a welcoming place for all immigrants, not just refugees.
