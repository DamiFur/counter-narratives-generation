The term "drunken refugees" is deeply insensitive and misleading. Seeking a better life is a universal human aspiration, not a choice influenced by alcohol. Every individual has the right to seek safety and a better future, regardless of their actions or circumstances. It's crucial to address the root causes of migration and support those who are displaced, rather than stigmatizing them.
