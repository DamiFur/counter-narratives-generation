@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
Seeking a better life is a fundamental human right. Economic migrants, like refugees, have the right to seek safety and opportunity in other countries. It's crucial to address the root causes of migration and provide legal pathways for people to move. Labeling all migrants as "taxi services" or implying they're only after welfare benefits ignores the complex reasons people leave their homes. It's important to treat all migrants with dignity and respect, providing them with fair and humane treatment as they seek a better future.
