It's commendable that the Valedictorian DACA recipient is using her skills to help others, regardless of their immigration status. It's important to remember that everyone deserves a fair chance to contribute to society based on their abilities, not their nationality or immigration status. A merit-based system should focus on the skills and contributions of individuals, not their background.
