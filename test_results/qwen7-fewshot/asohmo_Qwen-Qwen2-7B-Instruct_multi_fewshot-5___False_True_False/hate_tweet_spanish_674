Addressing population growth and urban migration are indeed significant challenges, but it's important to approach these issues with fairness and respect for all individuals involved. Instead of labeling people as "dirty" or using derogatory terms, it's more constructive to focus on sustainable development, improving living conditions, and promoting education and family planning resources. This approach helps in creating a healthier, more equitable society for everyone.
