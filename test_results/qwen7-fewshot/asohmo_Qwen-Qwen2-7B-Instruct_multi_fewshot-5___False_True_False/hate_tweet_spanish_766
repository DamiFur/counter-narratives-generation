" the ngo rescueship lifeline will now go to malta this is the wrong signal for all the humancatcher from the ngos the crew should send into jail because the have ignored the law and the refugees should be brought back to libya https://t co/hp1yvydepf"
Rescuing people in distress at sea is a humanitarian duty, not a violation of law. Libya is not a safe place for refugees. The Lifeline should continue its mission to bring refugees to safety, respecting international law and humanitarian principles. Jailing the crew would set a harmful precedent and undermine global efforts to protect human rights.
