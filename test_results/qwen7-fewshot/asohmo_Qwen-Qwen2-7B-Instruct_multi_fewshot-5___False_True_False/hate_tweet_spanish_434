@user who care for these children of criminal refugees really they play no role in times of overpopulation
Caring for children, regardless of their parents' criminal background or immigration status, is a fundamental responsibility of society. Overpopulation is a complex issue influenced by various factors including birth rates, migration, and resource availability. Focusing on the well-being of children ensures they have access to education, healthcare, and a safe environment, which are crucial for their development. It's important to address the root causes of overpopulation through sustainable development, family planning education, and improving living conditions, rather than blaming specific groups of people.
