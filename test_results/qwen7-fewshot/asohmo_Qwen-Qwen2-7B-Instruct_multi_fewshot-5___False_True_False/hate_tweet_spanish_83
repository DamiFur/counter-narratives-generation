It's important to remember that comprehensive immigration reform is about more than just walls. It's about creating a fair and just system that respects human dignity and the rule of law. Every person deserves the opportunity to contribute positively to society, regardless of their immigration status. Let's focus on building bridges, not walls, and fostering inclusive policies that support all members of our communities. #FairImmigrationReform #UnityNotWalls
