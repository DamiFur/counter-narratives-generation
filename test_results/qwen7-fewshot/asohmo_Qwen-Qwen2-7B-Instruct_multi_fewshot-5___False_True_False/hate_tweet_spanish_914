This type of rhetoric is harmful and divisive. It's important to remember that it's the actions of individuals, not an entire group, that should be judged. Every person, regardless of ethnicity or background, has the potential to contribute positively to society. Let's focus on unity and respect for all individuals. #UnityNotDivide #EqualRightsForAll
