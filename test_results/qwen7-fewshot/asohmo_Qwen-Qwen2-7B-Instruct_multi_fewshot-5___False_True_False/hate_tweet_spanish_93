street interview whit italians "send all migrants back to where they came from they block streets to pray " - free speech time - https://t co/d5dqr8pg3r @user
Freedom of speech is a precious right, but it comes with responsibility. When exercising this right, it's important to do so with respect and consideration for others. The comments you mentioned seem to lack empathy and understanding towards the challenges faced by migrants. It's crucial to engage in dialogue that promotes understanding, respect, and inclusivity. Remember, every voice matters, but every voice should contribute positively to the conversation.
