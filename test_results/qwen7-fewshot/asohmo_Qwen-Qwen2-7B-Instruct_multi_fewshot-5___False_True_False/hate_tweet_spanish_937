In times of uncertainty, it's important to focus on unity and respect for all individuals, regardless of their origin. Identity is not defined by where someone comes from, but by the values and contributions they bring to our society. Let's celebrate diversity, support fair immigration policies, and ensure that everyone has a chance to contribute positively to our communities. #UnityNotDivision #EqualOpportunity #DiversityIsStrength
