@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
Addressing the issue of asylum claims by long-term undocumented immigrants, it's crucial to understand the complexities and nuances of immigration law. The one-year rule you're referring to generally applies to individuals who are seeking asylum in the U.S. for the first time after entering the country illegally. However, this rule does not apply to those who have been continuously present in the U. S. for at least one year before making an asylum claim if they can demonstrate that returning to their home country would place them in danger due to specific reasons like persecution or fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.It's important to advocate for a fair and just immigration system that respects the rights of all individuals while ensuring national security and the rule of law. Encouraging dialogue and understanding around these issues can lead to more equitable policies and practices.
