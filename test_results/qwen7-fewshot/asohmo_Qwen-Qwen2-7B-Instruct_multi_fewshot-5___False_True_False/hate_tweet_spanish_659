The concept of "credible fear" at the border refers to a claim made by individuals seeking asylum, indicating they have a well-founded fear of persecution if returned to their home country. Under any administration, it's crucial to process these claims fairly and in accordance with international law and humanitarian principles. Immediate deportation without due process could lead to serious human rights violations. Let's focus on humane and legal immigration policies that respect human rights and the rule of law. #AsylumRights #FairProcess #HumanitarianApproach
