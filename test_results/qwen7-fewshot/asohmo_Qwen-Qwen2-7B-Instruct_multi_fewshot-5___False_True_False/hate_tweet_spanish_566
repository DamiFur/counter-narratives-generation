@user @user agree with your idea to use the army to build the wall do it hashtag buildthatwall hashtag buildthewall
Constructing walls doesn't solve the complex issues related to immigration. A more effective approach would be to invest in comprehensive immigration policies, border security, and humanitarian aid. This would address the root causes of migration and ensure fair treatment for all individuals. Let's focus on unity and understanding rather than division. #UnityNotWalls
