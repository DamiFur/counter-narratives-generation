It's concerning to hear about the strain on public assistance programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security in the Americas. It's important to remember that these systems are designed to support those in need, and any cuts can significantly impact the lives of many Americans. It's crucial to have a fair and inclusive conversation about how we can sustain these vital services while also considering the needs of immigrants. Let's focus on solutions that can help maintain the status quo and perhaps even improve these systems for the future. #SupportPublicServices #InclusiveConversation
