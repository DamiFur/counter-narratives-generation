Addressing illegal immigration is a complex issue that requires comprehensive solutions rather than simplistic hashtags. It's important to consider the root causes of migration, provide humanitarian aid, and ensure a fair and just legal pathway for those seeking a better life. Deportation policies should be humane and consider the impact on families and communities. Let's focus on building a system that is both secure and compassionate. #humaneimmigration #justpolicy
