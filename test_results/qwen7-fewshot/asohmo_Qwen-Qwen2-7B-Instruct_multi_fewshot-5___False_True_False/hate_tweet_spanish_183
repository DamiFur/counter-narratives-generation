Constructing walls or limiting migration policies doesn't address the root causes of illegal immigration. It's important to focus on comprehensive immigration reform that respects the rule of law, promotes family reunification, and provides a pathway to citizenship for those already in the country. This approach would empower hardworking Americans by ensuring a fair and just system, rather than perpetuating division and misinformation. Let's move forward with solutions that unite rather than divide. #UnityNotWalls #FairImmigrationReform #MagaWithHeart
