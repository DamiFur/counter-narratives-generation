Addressing the issue of illegal migrants and those with expired visas is important, but it should be done with fairness and respect for human rights.

Immediate deportation without due process could lead to serious human rights violations. Let's ensure that every individual is given a fair chance to present their case and that actions are taken within the bounds of the law.
