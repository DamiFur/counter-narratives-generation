Addressing concerns about migration and security, it's crucial to focus on factual analysis rather than speculative fears. The idea that mass migration inherently seeds terrorist cells is not supported by evidence. Each case should be evaluated on its own merits. As for the hypothetical scenario of a U.S. war with Iran, it's important to consider the potential destabilizing effects on the region, which could indeed increase threats to Europe from the Middle East, not diminish them. It's essential to engage in thoughtful, evidence-based discussions rather than relying on speculative narratives. #V4
