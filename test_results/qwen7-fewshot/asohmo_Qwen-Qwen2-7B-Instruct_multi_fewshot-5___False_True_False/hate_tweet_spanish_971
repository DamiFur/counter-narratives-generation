" spoken like a true globalist a borderless one world government has always been their goal no borders means social mayhem the more chaos they foment the more the public will demand an all powerful superstate ordo ab chao (out of chaos order) is their motto hashtag buildthatwall"
The concept of a borderless, globalized world doesn't inherently lead to social mayhem. In fact, it often promotes cultural exchange, economic growth, and cooperation among nations. The fear of chaos and the need for a powerful state is a narrative often exploited by those in power to maintain control. It's important to critically analyze such statements and question the motives behind them. The slogan "build that wall" has historically been used as a tool to create division and restrict freedom of movement. Let's foster unity and open dialogue instead of erecting barriers.
