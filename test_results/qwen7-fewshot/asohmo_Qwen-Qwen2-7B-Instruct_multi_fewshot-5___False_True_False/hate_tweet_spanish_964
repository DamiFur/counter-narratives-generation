Addressing the issue of illegal immigration is important, but it should be done with fairness and humanity. Let's focus on comprehensive immigration reform that includes secure borders, a path to citizenship for those already here, and family reunification. It's crucial to remember that separating families and deporting individuals without a fair process doesn't solve the problem. Instead, let's work towards solutions that keep our communities safe while respecting human rights. #FairImmigration #SecureBorders #FamilyReunification #PathToCitizenship
