Celebrating Labor Day should be about acknowledging the hard work and contributions of all workers, regardless of their immigration status. It's important to remember that immigrants, both legal and undocumented, contribute significantly to our economy and society. Instead of focusing on division and exclusion, let's celebrate the spirit of work and unity. Happy Labor Day to all workers who contribute to the strength and diversity of our nation. #LaborDay #Unity #InclusiveAmerica
