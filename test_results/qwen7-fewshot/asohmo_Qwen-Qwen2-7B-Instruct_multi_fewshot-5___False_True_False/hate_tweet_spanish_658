@user must deport all illegal migrants india already reeling under constant threat of muslim radicals curb population
Addressing the issue of illegal migration is complex and requires a nuanced approach rather than simplistic solutions. India, like many other countries, faces challenges related to security and population growth. However, deporting all illegal migrants isn't a sustainable or humane solution. It's crucial to implement policies that focus on integration, legal pathways for migration, and support for local communities affected by population changes. Additionally, addressing the root causes of migration, such as poverty, lack of opportunities, and political instability in the migrants' home countries, should be a priority. Engaging in dialogue and cooperation with neighboring countries can also help manage migration flows more effectively.
