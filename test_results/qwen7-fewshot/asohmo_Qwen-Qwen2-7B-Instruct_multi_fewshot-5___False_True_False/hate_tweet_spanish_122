@user hello?? stop groping my nation schneider: current migrant crisis " represents a plan orchestrated and prepared for a long time by international powers to radically alter christian and national identity of european peoples " http
The current migrant crisis is a complex issue influenced by various factors, including humanitarian needs, economic disparities, and political instability. It's important to address the root causes of migration rather than attributing it to a "plan" orchestrated by international powers. Focusing on integration, education, and economic opportunities can help stabilize regions and reduce the need for migration. Let's promote dialogue, understanding, and cooperation to find sustainable solutions.
