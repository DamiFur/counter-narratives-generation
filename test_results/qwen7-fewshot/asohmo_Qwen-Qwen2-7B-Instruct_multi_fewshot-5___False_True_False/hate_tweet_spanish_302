Freedom of speech is a cornerstone of democracy. Banning hate speech aims to protect individuals from harmful, discriminatory, or threatening language, not to suppress freedom of expression. It's crucial to distinguish between criticism and hate speech, ensuring that all voices are heard without inciting violence or discrimination. Misconceptions linking hate speech regulation to crime rates or immigration policies can lead to misunderstandings and fear-mongering. Let's focus on constructive dialogue and evidence-based policies. #UnitedAgainstHate
