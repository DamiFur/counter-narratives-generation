It's important to remember that discussions about immigration policies should focus on facts and the well-being of all individuals involved, rather than on divisive rhetoric. It's crucial to ensure that everyone, regardless of their immigration status, has access to basic necessities like housing and support systems. Let's aim for inclusive policies that benefit the entire community. #factsoverfear #compassionfirst
