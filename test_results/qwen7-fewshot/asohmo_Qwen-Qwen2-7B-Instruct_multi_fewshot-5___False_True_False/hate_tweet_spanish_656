@user sheme there is no attention on our own people and foodbanks while do you have to be a migrant to be treated with respect?
It's disheartening to hear about the lack of attention towards local communities and food banks. Everyone, regardless of their background, deserves respect and support. It's crucial that we focus on our own communities first, ensuring that basic needs like food are met for everyone. Let's advocate for equal treatment and resources for all members of our society.
