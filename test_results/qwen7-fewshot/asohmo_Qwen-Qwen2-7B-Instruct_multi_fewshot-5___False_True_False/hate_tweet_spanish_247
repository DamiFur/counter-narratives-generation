Rape is a heinous crime and should be condemned wherever it occurs, regardless of the perpetrator's background or nationality. It's important to address the issue based on facts and evidence, not stereotypes or assumptions. In Germany and France, as in any other country, law enforcement agencies should investigate all reports of rape equally and ensure that justice is served for the victims. It's crucial to remember that the actions of a few do not define an entire group and to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes that can lead to discrimination and further social division. Let's focus on supporting victims, promoting justice, and fostering a society that respects human rights for all individuals, regardless of their ethnicity, religion, or nationality.
