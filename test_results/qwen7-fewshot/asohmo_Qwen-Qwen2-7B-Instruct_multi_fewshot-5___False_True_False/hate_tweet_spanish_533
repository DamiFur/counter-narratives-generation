@user theres an agenda jprdan: white genocide is a crime eu funded report tells journalists not to write negative articles on migrant crisis "it even urges them to report colleagues to the authorities for hate speech crimes "https://t
The concept of "white genocide" is often used in a divisive and misleading way. It's crucial for journalists to report facts without bias, and to uphold freedom of speech while respecting the law. Encouraging self-censorship under the guise of avoiding "hate speech" can stifle important dialogue and democratic discourse. It's important to foster an environment where diverse perspectives can be shared openly and respectfully.
