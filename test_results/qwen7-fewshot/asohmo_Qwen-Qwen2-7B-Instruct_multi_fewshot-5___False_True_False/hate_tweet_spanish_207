It's crucial to address the root causes of extremism and ensure the safety and integration of all communities. Banning families based on the actions of a few doesn't solve the problem. Instead, we should focus on rehabilitation, support for reintegration, and strong measures to prevent radicalization. Every individual deserves a fair chance to contribute positively to society, regardless of their past.
