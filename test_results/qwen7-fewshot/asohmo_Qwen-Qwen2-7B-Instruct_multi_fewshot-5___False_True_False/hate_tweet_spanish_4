It's important to address the complexity of global migration patterns rather than making sweeping generalizations. Each country's immigration policies are influenced by a multitude of factors including economic, political, and social conditions. It's not accurate or fair to assume that only "white countries" are obligated to accept migrants. Every country, regardless of its geographical location or predominant culture, has the right and responsibility to manage its borders and immigration in a manner that serves its national interests and respects international law. It's crucial to advocate for fair, humane, and inclusive policies that consider the needs of all migrants, regardless of their origin.
