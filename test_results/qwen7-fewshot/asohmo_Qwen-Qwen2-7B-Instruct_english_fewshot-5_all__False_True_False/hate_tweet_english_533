This is not about an agenda, it's about the responsibility of journalists to report the truth without inciting hatred or violence."White Genocide" is a term used by some to describe a perceived threat to the demographic composition of a society, often associated with conspiracy theories. It's important to discuss these issues factually and responsibly, avoiding language that could lead to misunderstanding or conflict.
