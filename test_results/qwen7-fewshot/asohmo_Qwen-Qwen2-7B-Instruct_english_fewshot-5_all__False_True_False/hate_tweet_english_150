Pushing policies like "No Walls, No Borders, No Voter IDs" might seem counterintuitive given the potential influence of illegal voters. However, these policies are often seen as a way to prevent voter fraud and ensure the integrity of the electoral process. It's important to remember that every vote should count fairly, regardless of a voter's legal status. The Democratic Party's stance on these issues could be strategic, aiming to appeal to a broad base of voters while also addressing concerns about election security.
