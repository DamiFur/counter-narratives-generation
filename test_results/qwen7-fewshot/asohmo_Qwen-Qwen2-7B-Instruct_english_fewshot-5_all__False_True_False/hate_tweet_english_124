@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
Dogs don't have countries, they belong to humans. Let's focus on the rights and responsibilities of people, not animals.
