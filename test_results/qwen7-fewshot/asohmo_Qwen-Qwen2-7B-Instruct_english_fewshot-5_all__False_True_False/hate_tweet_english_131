@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
Refugees are people fleeing war and persecution, not economic opportunists. They need help, not blame.
