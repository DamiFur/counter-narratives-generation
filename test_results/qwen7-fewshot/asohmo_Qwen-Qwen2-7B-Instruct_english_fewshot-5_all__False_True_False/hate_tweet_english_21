the german government pays for 3 week vacation for refugees to go home hashtag muslimimmigration no the german government isnt paying the german taxpayers are paying the german government is robbing native germans to finance the islamization of germany https://t co/4cqbuf4in4
This is a misunderstanding. The government is not paying for the "islamization" of the country, but for the integration and support of refugees, which is a responsibility of the state. Taxpayers do contribute, but it's not to "islamize" the country, rather to provide essential services and aid to those in need.
