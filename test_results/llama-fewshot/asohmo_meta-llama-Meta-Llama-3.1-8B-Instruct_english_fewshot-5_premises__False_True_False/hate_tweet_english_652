@user " can you think of a place that has been improved by mass immigration or the movements of large numbers of refugees ?" "not one the immigration policies in europe are a disaster youre destroying europe youre destroying the culture√¢
I'd like to point out that there are many examples of places that have been positively impacted by mass immigration and refugee movements, such as the United States, Canada, and Australia. These countries have a long history of welcoming immigrants and refugees, and it has contributed to their economic growth, cultural diversity, and social progress.
