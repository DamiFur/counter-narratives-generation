I'm glad you brought this up. Let's talk about the complex history of the United States. You're right, the land that is now the United States was indeed originally inhabited by Native American communities. However, the idea that "our immigrant ancestors" simply "stole" the land is an oversimplification.The history of colonization and the displacement of Native Americans is a painful and multifaceted one, involving the actions of governments, corporations, and individuals. It's essential to acknowledge the trauma and injustices inflicted upon Native American communities and to recognize the ongoing struggles they face today.It's also worth noting that many Native American communities have been advocating for their rights and self-determination for centuries, long before the concept of "immigrant ancestors" was even relevant. Let's strive for a more nuanced understanding of this complex history and work towards a more inclusive and equitable future.
