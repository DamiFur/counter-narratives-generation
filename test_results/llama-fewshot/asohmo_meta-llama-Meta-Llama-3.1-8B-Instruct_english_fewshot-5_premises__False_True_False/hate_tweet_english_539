@user will islam ever be at peace with its self as it goes to war with itsel f no wonder uk people do not accept its refugees
Islam is a religion with over 1.8 billion followers, and like any other faith, it has a diverse range of perspectives and interpretations. To generalize that Islam as a whole is at war with itself oversimplifies the complexities of the issue.Moreover, the UK's decision to accept or reject refugees is a complex issue influenced by various factors, including politics, economics, and social considerations, not solely based on the religion of the refugees.
