I'm so sorry for the loss of the doctor's life and the trauma his daughter went through. However, let's not forget that the vast majority of asylum seekers and migrants are not violent criminals. They are human beings seeking safety and a better life for themselves and their families. Generalizing an entire group based on the actions of a few is not only unfair, but also counterproductive to finding real solutions to the complex issues surrounding immigration.
