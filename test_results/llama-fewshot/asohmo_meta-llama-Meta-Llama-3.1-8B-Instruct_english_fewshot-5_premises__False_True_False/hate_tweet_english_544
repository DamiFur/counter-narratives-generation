I'd like to offer a different perspective. Mass migration can be a complex issue, and it's not accurate to attribute it solely to the Islamic world. Many factors contribute to migration, including economic instability, conflict, and climate change. Furthermore, a US war with Iran could lead to unintended consequences, such as increased instability in the region and a rise in extremist groups. Let's focus on addressing the root causes of migration and promoting peaceful coexistence, rather than resorting to simplistic or divisive rhetoric.
