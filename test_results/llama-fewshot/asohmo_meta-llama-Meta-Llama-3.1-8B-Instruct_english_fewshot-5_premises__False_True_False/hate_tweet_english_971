" spoken like a true globalist a borderless one world government has always been their goal no borders means social mayhem the more chaos they foment the more the public will demand an all powerful superstate ordo ab chao (out of chaos order) is their motto hashtag buildthatwall"
That's a classic conspiracy theory. There's no evidence to support the idea that a "one world government" is a real goal of globalists or that a borderless world would lead to social mayhem. In fact, many countries have open borders with their neighbors and have not descended into chaos.
