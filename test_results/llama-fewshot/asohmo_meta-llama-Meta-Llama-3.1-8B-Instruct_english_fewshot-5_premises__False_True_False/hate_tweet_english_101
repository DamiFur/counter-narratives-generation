@user time to start firing judges who dont detain immigrants so @user can deport if he was detain and not given a bond that citizen would be alive
So you're saying that a judge's decision not to detain someone led to a citizen's death. That's a serious accusation. Can you provide evidence to support this claim, or is this just a baseless attack on the judiciary?
