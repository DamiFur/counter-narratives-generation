@user tough decisions mean easy ones ban those families who supported isis in germany they murdered many and if you do not learn from recent events like mass immigration rises in rape and crime family isis deserve no return to the country the
I see you're calling for the punishment of entire families for the actions of a few. That's not justice, that's collective punishment. What about due process and the rights of those who may not have supported ISIS?
