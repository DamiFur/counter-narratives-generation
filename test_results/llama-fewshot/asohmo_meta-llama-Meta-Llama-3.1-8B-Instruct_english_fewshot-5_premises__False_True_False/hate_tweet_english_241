americans agree with @user on hashtag immigration we can not afford to give welfare to illegals while u s citizens are homeless hashtag votedemsout hashtag familiesbelongtogethermarch https://t co/f3dteejp34
I'd like to point out that "illegals" is a derogatory term. Let's use "undocumented immigrants" instead.That being said, the fact that some Americans may agree with you doesn't necessarily mean that the issue is as simple as you're making it out to be. There are many complexities to consider, such as the economic contributions of undocumented immigrants, their impact on local communities, and the moral obligation to provide basic necessities like food and shelter to those in need.It's also worth noting that homelessness among U.S. citizens is a multifaceted issue that requires a comprehensive solution, not a simplistic one that targets a specific group of people.
