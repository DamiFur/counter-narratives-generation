@user i just read the guy that broke into many homes including chef jaime oliver was let go but dont call a refugee a rapefugee or the soros sponsored police of the uk will not let you go
I see you're trying to conflate two different issues. One person breaking into homes is a crime, and the other is a refugee seeking asylum. Let's not forget that refugees are human beings in need of help, not a label to be used as a political tool.
