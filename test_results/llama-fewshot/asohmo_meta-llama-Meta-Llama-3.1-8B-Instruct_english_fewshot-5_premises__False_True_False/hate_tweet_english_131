@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
That's a broad generalization. Every person has a unique story and reason for leaving their home country, and not all of them can be labeled as "economic migrants" or "invaders".
