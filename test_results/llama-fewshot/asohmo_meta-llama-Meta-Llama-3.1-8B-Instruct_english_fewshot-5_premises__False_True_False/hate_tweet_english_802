@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
It's easy to label people as "economic migrants" or "posing as refugees," but have you considered that they might be fleeing war, persecution, or violence in their home countries, just like the "real refugees" you're comparing them to?
