regardless of intent the term " undocumented immigrant " is incorrect because illegal aliens are foreigners (i e aliens ) who are unlawfully present in the united states (i e illegal) https://t co/aarjtduwya https://t co/hkrv7mpzok
I'd like to clarify that the term "undocumented immigrant" is widely used and accepted by many organizations, including the United Nations and the US government, to refer to individuals who are in the country without proper documentation. It's a more neutral and respectful term than "illegal aliens," which can be stigmatizing and dehumanizing.
