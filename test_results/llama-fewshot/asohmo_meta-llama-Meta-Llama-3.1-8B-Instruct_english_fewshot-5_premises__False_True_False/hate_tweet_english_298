orban declares easterneurope free of refugees he says that soros want to make europe to a multiculturell society which is poor https://t co/puqlwnxtyj
I'd like to clarify that George Soros is a Hungarian-American billionaire and philanthropist who supports various causes, including immigration and refugee rights. Labeling him as someone who "wants to make Europe a multicultural society" oversimplifies his views and ignores the complexities of the issue. It's also worth noting that a "multicultural society" can be a positive aspect of a country's identity, promoting diversity, understanding, and social cohesion.
