@user time to leave the uk commonwealth and europe that would end immigration people do not want more refugees enough is enough
I'd like to challenge the assumption that leaving the Commonwealth and Europe would end immigration. History has shown us that people will continue to migrate for various reasons, such as economic opportunities, safety, or family reunification, regardless of a country's membership in international organizations. It's essential to address the root causes of migration rather than just its symptoms.
