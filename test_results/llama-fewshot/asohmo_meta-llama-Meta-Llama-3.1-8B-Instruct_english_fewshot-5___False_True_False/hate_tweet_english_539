@user will islam ever be at peace with its self as it goes to war with itsel f no wonder uk people do not accept its refugees
I'd like to offer a different perspective. Islam is a diverse faith with over 1.8 billion adherents, and like any other religion, it has a wide range of interpretations and practices. The actions of a few individuals or groups do not represent the entire Muslim community. In fact, many Muslims are actively working towards peace, understanding, and coexistence with people of other faiths. It's also worth noting that the UK has a long history of accepting refugees and providing a safe haven for those fleeing conflict and persecution.
