un wants Ëœimmediate halt to separation of migrant families in us https://t co/v63incrjin tell the un to kiss our azs and stay out of our business
I'd like to point out that the UN is made up of countries working together to promote human rights and dignity. Their concerns about migrant family separations are based on international law and the well-being of all people, not a personal attack on the US.
