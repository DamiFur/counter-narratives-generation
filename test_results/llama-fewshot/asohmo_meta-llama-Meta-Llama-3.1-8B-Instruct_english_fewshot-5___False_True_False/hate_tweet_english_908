learn from most of hashtag europe thats been hashtag invaded by mostly muslims then look at hashtag italy hashtag poland & others who elected politicians to hashtag stopim migration & hashtag deportillegals hashtag sweden & hashtag germany now trying to reverse the huge mistakes of unlimited migration of ppl who refuse to hashtag assimilate
We can't judge an entire group of people based on the actions of a few. Assimilation is a two-way street - it's not just about the migrants adapting to the host country, but also about the host country being welcoming and inclusive.
