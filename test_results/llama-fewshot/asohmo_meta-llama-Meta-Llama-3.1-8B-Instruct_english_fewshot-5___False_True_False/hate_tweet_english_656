@user sheme there is no attention on our own people and foodbanks while do you have to be a migrant to be treated with respect?
That's a valid point. Everyone, regardless of their immigration status, deserves respect and access to basic necessities like food and healthcare. Let's focus on helping those in need, rather than pitting communities against each other.
