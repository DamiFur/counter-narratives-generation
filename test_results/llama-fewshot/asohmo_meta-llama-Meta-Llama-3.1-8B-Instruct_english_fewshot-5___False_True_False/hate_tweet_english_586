drunken refugees - is that sad or a nature law no refugee have to leave his country to have a better life this means he can also get dead on his journey for hope and so its better to stay home than to dream https://t co/hzyiafrp9m
I see a human being, not a 'drunken refugee.' Everyone deserves dignity and respect, regardless of their circumstances. Many people flee their homes due to war, persecution, or natural disasters, not just for a 'better life.'
