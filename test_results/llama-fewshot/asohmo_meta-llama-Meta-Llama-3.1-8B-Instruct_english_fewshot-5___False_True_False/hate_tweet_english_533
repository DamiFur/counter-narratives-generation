@user theres an agenda jprdan: white genocide is a crime eu funded report tells journalists not to write negative articles on migrant crisis "it even urges them to report colleagues to the authorities for hate speech crimes "https://t
I'd like to clarify that the term "white genocide" is often used to describe a conspiracy theory with no basis in fact. It's essential to rely on credible sources when discussing sensitive topics like this. The report you're referring to seems to be from a specific EU-funded project, but without more context, it's challenging to understand the full scope of the issue. It's also worth noting that freedom of the press is a cornerstone of democracy, and journalists should be able to report on sensitive topics without fear of retribution.
