israel is coming back to africa just 3 months ago african migrants and asylum seekers in israel were going to be forcibly coming back to africa as well hashtag israel hashtag comingtoafrica hashtag ethiopia https://t co/aknbrxhtj1
I'd like to point out that the situation in Israel is complex and multifaceted. While some African migrants have been deported, others have been allowed to stay and integrate into Israeli society. It's also worth noting that many African migrants have fled conflict, persecution, or poverty in their home countries and are seeking safety and a better life in Israel, just as many people have sought refuge in other countries around the world.
