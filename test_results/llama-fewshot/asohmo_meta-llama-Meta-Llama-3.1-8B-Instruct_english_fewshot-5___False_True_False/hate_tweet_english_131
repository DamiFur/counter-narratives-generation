@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
I'm sorry, but that's not entirely accurate. Many people who seek asylum are fleeing violence, persecution, or natural disasters in their home countries. They are not "invaders" or "colonizers." They are human beings seeking protection and a chance to rebuild their lives.
