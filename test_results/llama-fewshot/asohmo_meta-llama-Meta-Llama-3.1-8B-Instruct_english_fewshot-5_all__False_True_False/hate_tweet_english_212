I'd like to respond with a message that counters the hate and promotes a more inclusive and empathetic tone. Here's a possible response:"Let's focus on building bridges, not walls. New Zealand has a long history of welcoming refugees and providing a safe haven for those in need. We can learn from each other's experiences and work together to address the root causes of migration, rather than resorting to name-calling and shame. #RefugeesWelcome #CompassionInAction"
