@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
I see you're trying to distract from the real issue with a clever but irrelevant question about dogs. Let's focus on the rights and dignity of human beings, not their nationality or the places where their pets live.
