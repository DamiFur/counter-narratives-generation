@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
It's easy to label someone as an "economic migrant" when you don't know their story. What if they're fleeing war, persecution, or natural disasters in their home countries? Would you still call them a "taxi service" then?
