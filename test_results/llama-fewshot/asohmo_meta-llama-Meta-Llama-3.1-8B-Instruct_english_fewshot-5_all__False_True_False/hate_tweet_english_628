canada is an immigrant country dont change it to refugee country please
I'd like to point out that Canada is indeed an immigrant country, but it's also a country that has a long history of welcoming refugees and providing them with a safe haven. In fact, Canada has a reputation for being one of the most generous countries in the world when it comes to refugee resettlement.Rather than saying "don't change it to a refugee country", why not say "let's continue to provide a safe haven for those who need it, while also ensuring that our immigration system is fair and effective"?
