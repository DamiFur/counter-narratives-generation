meanwhile in europe nobody speaks the truth that all of the potential millions of migrants and refugees can not be taken into the euro zone former colonial powers like france &amp britain are not without guilt in the creation of the mess that is most of the african continent today
That's a valid point. Acknowledging the complex history and the role of colonial powers in shaping the current situation can lead to a more nuanced understanding of the issue. It's also worth noting that many African countries are still dealing with the consequences of colonialism, and addressing the root causes of migration, such as poverty, conflict, and lack of opportunities, could be a more effective long-term solution than just closing borders.
