@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
That's a complex issue, but let's look at it from the perspective of the people on those boats. They're often fleeing war, persecution, or extreme poverty, and they're seeking safety and a chance at a better life, just like many of our ancestors did when they came to this country. Not all of them are economic migrants, and not all of them pose as refugees. Many are genuine asylum seekers who deserve our compassion and our help.
