drunken refugees - is that sad or a nature law no refugee have to leave his country to have a better life this means he can also get dead on his journey for hope and so its better to stay home than to dream https://t co/hzyiafrp9m
I think it's sad that you think it's okay to dehumanize people who are desperate for a better life. Every human being deserves dignity and respect, regardless of their circumstances. Many refugees risk their lives to escape war, persecution, or natural disasters, not just for a "better life" but for survival.
