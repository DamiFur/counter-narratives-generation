@user theres an agenda jprdan: white genocide is a crime eu funded report tells journalists not to write negative articles on migrant crisis "it even urges them to report colleagues to the authorities for hate speech crimes "https://t
I'm concerned that you're spreading misinformation. The report you're referring to is likely the 2016 European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) report, which advises journalists on how to report on hate speech, not migrant crisis.
