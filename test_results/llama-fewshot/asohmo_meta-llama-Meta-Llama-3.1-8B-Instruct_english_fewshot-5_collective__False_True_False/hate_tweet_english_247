I'm so sorry to hear that you're concerned about the safety of your community. However, painting an entire group with a broad brush based on the actions of a few is not the solution. We need to focus on addressing the root causes of these issues, such as poverty, lack of education, and social isolation, rather than scapegoating a particular group. Let's work together to create a more inclusive and compassionate society where everyone feels safe and valued.
