@user will islam ever be at peace with its self as it goes to war with itsel f no wonder uk people do not accept its refugees
Islam, like any other religion, is made up of individuals, not a single entity that can "go to war" with itself. Most Muslims are peaceful and law-abiding citizens, just like people of any other faith.
