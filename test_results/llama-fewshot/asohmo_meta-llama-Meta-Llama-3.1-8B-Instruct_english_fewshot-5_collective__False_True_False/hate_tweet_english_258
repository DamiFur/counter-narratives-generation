japan is able to keep clean his country from refugees 2017 they accept only 20 from nearly 20 000 requests this is worldrecord https://t co/y6xvy2gxbc
I'd like to point out that Japan is a country with a unique set of circumstances, including a relatively small land area and a highly developed economy. It's also worth noting that Japan has a long history of cultural and social homogeneity, which can make it challenging for refugees to integrate.
