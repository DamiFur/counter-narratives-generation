@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
You're trying to distract from the real issue by bringing up dogs. Let's focus on people's rights and dignity, not their nationality or the fact that they have pets. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and kindness, regardless of where they come from.
