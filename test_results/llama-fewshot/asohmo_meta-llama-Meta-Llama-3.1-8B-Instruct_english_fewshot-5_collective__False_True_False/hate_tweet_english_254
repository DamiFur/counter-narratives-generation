but i thought hashtag white genocide wasnt real? hashtag deportthemigrants hashtag refugees notwelcome hashtag white pride
I'm glad you brought up "white genocide." Let's talk about the real genocide that's happening: the Rohingya in Myanmar, the Yazidis in Iraq, and the Uighurs in China. These communities are facing systematic violence and persecution, and the world is largely silent. Where's the outrage for them? Where's the "white pride" when it comes to standing up for human rights and dignity for all people, regardless of their skin color or nationality?
