regardless of intent the term " undocumented immigrant " is incorrect because illegal aliens are foreigners (i e aliens ) who are unlawfully present in the united states (i e illegal) https://t co/aarjtduwya https://t co/hkrv7mpzok
I don't understand the problem with the term "undocumented immigrants". It's just a way to say "people who were born in another country but are here illegally". What's wrong with that?
