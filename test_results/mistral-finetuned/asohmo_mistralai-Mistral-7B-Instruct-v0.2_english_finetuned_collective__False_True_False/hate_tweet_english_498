regardless of intent the term " undocumented immigrant " is incorrect because illegal aliens are foreigners (i e aliens ) who are unlawfully present in the united states (i e illegal) https://t co/aarjtduwya https://t co/hkrv7mpzok
I don't understand what you are trying to say. You are saying that "undocumented immigrants" are illegal, but at the same time you say that the term is incorrect because they are foreigners who are "unlawfully present" and not illegal. You are contradicting yourself.
