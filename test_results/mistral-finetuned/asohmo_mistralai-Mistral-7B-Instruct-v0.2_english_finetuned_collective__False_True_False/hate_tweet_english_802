@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
I don't think it's true that they only come to Europe to get welfare. I think most of them want to work and improve their lives.
