problem for the pm re johnson is that a person who sent round vans telling immigrants to go home is not in a position to lecture anyone on racism the lesson of which is: if you pander theyll take everything you give them and keep pushing for more
It is not true that he sent those vans, it is just a rumor. And even if it were true, it doesn't make him a racist, it makes him a xenophobe, which is not the same thing.
