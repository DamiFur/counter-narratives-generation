for all the people holding up signs regarding illegal immigrants hand them each a bill to pay the cost of how much these people take from the american taxpayer and i bet they would take down their signs and go home
 Illegal immigrants don't take anything from the American taxpayer. They work and pay taxes. The only thing they don't pay is social security and medicare because they are not eligible for it.
