meanwhile in europe nobody speaks the truth that all of the potential millions of migrants and refugees can not be taken into the euro zone former colonial powers like france &amp britain are not without guilt in the creation of the mess that is most of the african continent today
 It is a fact that European colonial powers have contributed to the problems in Africa, but it is not true that all migrants come from Africa and that they are all responsible for the problems in their countries. It is not fair to blame them for the mistakes of the past. Most of them are just looking for a better future for themselves and their families, and they have every right to do so.
