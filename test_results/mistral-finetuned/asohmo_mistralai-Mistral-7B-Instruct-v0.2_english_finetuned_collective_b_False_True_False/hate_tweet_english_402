 Refugees are not criminals. They are people who have been forced to leave their countries due to war, persecution or other reasons. They are not a threat to anyone. They are just looking for a safe place to live and build a future for themselves and their families. They don't want to take anything away from anyone. They just want to live in peace and dignity.
