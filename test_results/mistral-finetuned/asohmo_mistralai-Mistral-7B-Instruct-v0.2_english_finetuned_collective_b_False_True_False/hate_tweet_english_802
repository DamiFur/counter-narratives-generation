@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
 It's not true that all migrants come to Europe only for welfare benefits. Most of them are fleeing from war and persecution. They don't want to live on welfare, they want to work and live a decent life.
