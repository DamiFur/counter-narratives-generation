@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
 Are you saying that immigrants are not human beings? They are immigrants because they are looking for a better future for themselves and their families. They are not dogs. They are human beings like you and me.
