@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
Refugees are not economic migrants. They are people fleeing war and persecution. They are not invaders. They are just looking for a safe place to live.
