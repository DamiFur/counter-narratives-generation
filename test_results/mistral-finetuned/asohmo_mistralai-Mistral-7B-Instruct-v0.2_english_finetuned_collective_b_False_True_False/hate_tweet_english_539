@user will islam ever be at peace with its self as it goes to war with itsel f no wonder uk people do not accept its refugees
 Islam is not at war with itself, it is at war with terrorism and extremism. The vast majority of muslims are peaceful people who just want to live their lives in peace. Stop generalizing and stigmatizing an entire religion based on the actions of a few extremists.
