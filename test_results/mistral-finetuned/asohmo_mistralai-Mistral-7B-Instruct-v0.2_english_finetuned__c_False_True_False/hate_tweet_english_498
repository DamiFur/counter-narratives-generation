regardless of intent the term " undocumented immigrant " is incorrect because illegal aliens are foreigners (i e aliens ) who are unlawfully present in the united states (i e illegal) https://t co/aarjtduwya https://t co/hkrv7mpzok
I don't think that's true. The term "undocumented" doesn't mean "unlawful" or "illegal". It only means that they don't have a document that proves that they are in the country legally.
