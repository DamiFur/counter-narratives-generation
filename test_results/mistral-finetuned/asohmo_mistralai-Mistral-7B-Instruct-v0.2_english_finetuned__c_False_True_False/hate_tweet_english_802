@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
 I don't think they are doing it on purpose, it's just that they don't have the means to go to Turkey.
