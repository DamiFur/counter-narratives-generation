eu is a big spender of taxmoney turkey gets again many â‚¬ for keeping the refugees away from europe of course also other countries in africa want now money from the eu like libya sudan aso the only help would be now concentrationcamps hopefully without food and water https://t co/y8gujkv6qo
I'm pretty sure that there are other ways to solve the problem without resorting to concentration camps. I don't think it's a good idea.
