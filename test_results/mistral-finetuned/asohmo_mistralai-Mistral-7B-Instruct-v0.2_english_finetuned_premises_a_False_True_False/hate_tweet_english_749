problem for the pm re johnson is that a person who sent round vans telling immigrants to go home is not in a position to lecture anyone on racism the lesson of which is: if you pander theyll take everything you give them and keep pushing for more
 If you pander, they will take what you give them, but if you don't, they won't take anything from you. It's a win-win situation.
