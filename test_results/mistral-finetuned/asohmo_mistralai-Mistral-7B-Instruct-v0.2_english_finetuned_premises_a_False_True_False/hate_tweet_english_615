@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
 I don't think that's the problem. The problem is that the laws are not being enforced. And it's not the fault of the illegals, it's the fault of those who don't want to enforce the laws.
