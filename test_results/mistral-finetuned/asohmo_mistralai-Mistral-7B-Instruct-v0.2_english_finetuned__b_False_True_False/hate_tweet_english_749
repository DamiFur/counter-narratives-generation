problem for the pm re johnson is that a person who sent round vans telling immigrants to go home is not in a position to lecture anyone on racism the lesson of which is: if you pander theyll take everything you give them and keep pushing for more
Immigrants do not take everything that is given to them, and they do not push for more. Immigrants are hardworking people who just want to build a better future for themselves and their families. They do not take anything that is not rightfully theirs.
