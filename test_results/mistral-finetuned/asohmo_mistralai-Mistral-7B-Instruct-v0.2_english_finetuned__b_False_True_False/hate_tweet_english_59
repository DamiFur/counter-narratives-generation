@user families should not bring their kids into a country illegally would you? we cant afford them hashtag send them home
Do you really think it's that easy? Do you know how hard it is for them to come here? Do you think they want to leave their countries? They are forced to leave because of war, hunger and poverty. Do you know what they go through on the way here? They risk their lives and their children's lives just to have a chance at a better future. They are not criminals, they are refugees. They are fleeing their countries because they have no other choice. They don't want to come here illegally, they want to come legally but they can't because there are no legal ways for them to do so. Do you really think they are taking advantage of us? They are not taking anything from us, they are only asking for our help. Do you think we can't afford them? We can afford them, we can afford to give them shelter, food and education. We can afford it because they are human beings and they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.
