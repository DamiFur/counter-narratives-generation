@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
They are refugees. They are fleeing war and persecution. They are not economic migrants. They don't come to Europe to seek welfare. They come to Europe because they don't have any other choice.
