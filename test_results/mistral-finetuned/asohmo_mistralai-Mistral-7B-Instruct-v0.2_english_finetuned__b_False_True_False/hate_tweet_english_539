@user will islam ever be at peace with its self as it goes to war with itsel f no wonder uk people do not accept its refugees
There is no war between Muslims and Muslims. There is a war against terrorism and extremism. The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful people who want nothing more than to live in peace and harmony with their neighbors.
