meanwhile in europe nobody speaks the truth that all of the potential millions of migrants and refugees can not be taken into the euro zone former colonial powers like france &amp britain are not without guilt in the creation of the mess that is most of the african continent today
This is not true. Most of the migrants are not refugees. They are economic migrants. Most of them are young men. They are not fleeing war or persecution. They are just looking for a better life. They do not want to live in refugee camps. They want to come to Europe and work and send money back home to their families.
