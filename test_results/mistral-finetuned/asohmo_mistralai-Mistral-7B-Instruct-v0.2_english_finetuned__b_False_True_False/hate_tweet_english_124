@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
Immigrants don't have a country, they have a home. They don't steal jobs, they create them. They are not criminals, they are the victims of criminals.
