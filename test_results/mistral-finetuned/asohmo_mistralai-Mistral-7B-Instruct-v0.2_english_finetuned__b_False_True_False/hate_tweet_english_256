It is not fair to blame an entire group of people for the actions of a few. It is important to remember that the majority of refugees are not criminals or terrorists. They are fleeing from war, persecution, and poverty. They are just looking for a better life for themselves and their families. They are not a threat to anyone. They are the victims, not the perpetrators.
