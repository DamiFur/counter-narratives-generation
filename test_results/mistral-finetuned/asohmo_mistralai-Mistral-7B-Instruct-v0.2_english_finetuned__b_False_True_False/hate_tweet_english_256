about 3700 refugee medicine doctors are allowed to work in germany in hospitals now they realize that some of them are not on the standard of western medicine and often some buyed the certificats home without knowledge so some patients died https://t co/belfz7m72z
There is no evidence that the doctors in question are responsible for the deaths of any patients. In fact, there is no evidence to suggest that these doctors are any less competent than their German counterparts. This is just another example of xenophobic fear-mongering.
