Doctors and surgeons have been killed in the US as well. This is not an immigration problem, it is a crime problem. You should not blame immigrants for the crimes committed by a few of them. The majority of immigrants are hardworking people who are just trying to build a better life for themselves and their families. It is not fair to judge them all based on the actions of a few.
