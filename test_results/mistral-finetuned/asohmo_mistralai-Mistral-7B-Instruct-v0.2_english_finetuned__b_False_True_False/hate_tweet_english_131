@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
There is a huge difference between refugees and economic migrants. Refugees are people who are forced to leave their country due to war or persecution. Economic migrants are people who leave their country in search of better economic opportunities. They are not the same thing.
