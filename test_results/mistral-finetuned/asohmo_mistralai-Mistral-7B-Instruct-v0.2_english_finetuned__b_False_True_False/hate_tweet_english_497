@user i just read the guy that broke into many homes including chef jaime oliver was let go but dont call a refugee a rapefugee or the soros sponsored police of the uk will not let you go
There is no evidence that refugees are more likely to commit crimes than the native population. This is a common misconception. In fact, refugees are much more likely to be victims of crime than perpetrators. The vast majority of refugees are fleeing war, persecution and poverty and are just looking for a safe place to live and build a new life for themselves and their families. They are not criminals and do not pose a threat to anyone.
