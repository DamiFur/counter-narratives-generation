Illegal immigrants do not pay taxes, they are not a benefit to the US, they are a burden on the US taxpayers, they are here illegally, they are breaking the law, they should be sent back to their countries of origin, they should not be rewarded for breaking the law by being allowed to stay in the US, the US should not be a sanctuary country for illegal immigrants, the US immigration laws should be enforced, the US border should be secured, the US government should stop rewarding illegal immigration and start enforcing the immigration laws and securing the US border.
