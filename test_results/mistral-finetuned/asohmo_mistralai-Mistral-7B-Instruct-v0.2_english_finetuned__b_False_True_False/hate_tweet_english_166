@user a gang of streets sellers ? this is " bbc speak " what u meant to say was third world illegal immigrants hashtag lbc
They are not "third world illegal immigrants" they are "street sellers" because they don't have a job and they are trying to sell something to make a living. They are not criminals, they are just poor people trying to survive. You should be ashamed of yourself.
