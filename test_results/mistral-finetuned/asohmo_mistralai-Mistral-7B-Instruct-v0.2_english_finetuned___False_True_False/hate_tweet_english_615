@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
The law states that they have to claim it within a year of their arrival, not that they can't claim it if they didn't do it on time.
