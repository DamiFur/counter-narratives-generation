@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
I don't understand what you are trying to say. Are you implying that immigrants don't have the right to be in their own country? That doesn't make sense.
