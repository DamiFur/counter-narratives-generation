@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
It's not fair that someone who has been in the country for a long time should not be able to claim asylum if they haven't done anything wrong.It's important to treat everyone equally, regardless of their status.
