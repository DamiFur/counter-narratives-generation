meanwhile in europe nobody speaks the truth that all of the potential millions of migrants and refugees can not be taken into the euro zone former colonial powers like france &amp britain are not without guilt in the creation of the mess that is most of the african continent today
I see where you're coming from, but I'm not sure I agree with you on this one.It's important to remember that every country has its own challenges, and it's not necessarily the case that every country will be able to handle the influx of refugees and migrants.That being said, it's important to address the root causes of migration, such as poverty, lack of education, and discrimination, and to work towards creating a more just and equitable society.
