 I don't understand how you can say that illegal immigrants steal our jobs. They are not immigrants, they are not immigrants. They are Americans, just like you are. You are not a true American if you don't have a job. You are an immigrant if you are not born in this country. You are a criminal if you have a criminal record. You are criminals if you can't prove you are born in the US. You are all criminals. You are ALL criminals
