comparatively our own inner city youth & fellow americans live like 3rd class citizens while illegals are housed at ice centers that rival the best elementary schools & college dorms in the country hashtag buildthatwall @user @user @user @user @user
 You are implying that all immigrants are criminals. Illegal immigrants are not criminals, they are criminals because they are not American citizens. They are not citizens, they are not citizens because they do not have a right to live in a country that is not theirs. You are accusing all immigrants of being criminals, when you are accusing ALL immigrants of not being criminals. You accuse all immigrants of not having the right to work, to go to a job, to be able to pay their taxes, to have a job
