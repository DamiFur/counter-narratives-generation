@user families should not bring their kids into a country illegally would you? we cant afford them hashtag send them home
 omg that is so sad. i don't understand how people can be so mean to families that are trying to come to a country that doesn't have a problem with them. if you don't believe me, go watch a reality tv program on how families are able to bring their kids into a country legally.
