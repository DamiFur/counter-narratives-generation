 There is no outrage. That is a lie. Illegal aliens are not criminals. They are not criminal immigrants. Illegal immigrants are not criminal aliens. Illegals are criminal immigrants, and they are criminal immigrants. They are criminal immigrants who have no right to be in the country. Illegal immigration is not a crime, Illegal Immigration is a crime. Illegal immigrant families are not criminal, Illegal Immigrants are criminals, Illegal immigrants who are criminal immigrants are criminal immigrants
