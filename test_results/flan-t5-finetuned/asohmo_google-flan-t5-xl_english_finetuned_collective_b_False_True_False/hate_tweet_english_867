 You are implying that immigrants are not able to take care of themselves. You are wrong. Most immigrants are able to do that. Most immigrants do not live off US taxpayers. Most immigrants work hard and pay taxes. Most immigrants pay taxes and work hard. Most immigrants don't pay taxes and don't work hard.
