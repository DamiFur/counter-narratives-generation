@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
 I don't think you should stop at Turkey just because you don't like the way the government treats its citizens. Stopping at a foreign country is not the same as stopping at a refugee camp.
