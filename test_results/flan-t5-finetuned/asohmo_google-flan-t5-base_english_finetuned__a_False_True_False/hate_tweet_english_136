for all the people holding up signs regarding illegal immigrants hand them each a bill to pay the cost of how much these people take from the american taxpayer and i bet they would take down their signs and go home
 I don't see the relationship between signing up for a job and paying for someone else's ineligibility. Neither do I see the relation between paying for something done by an immigrant and taking it from the taxpayer.
