rich african countries dont take in african migrants rich muslim countries dont take in muslim migrants rich latin american countries dont take it latin migrants but white countries are suppose to accept them ??
 I don't see any relationship between accepting immigrants and accepting white people. It's not that they are "taken" from the outside, it's just that they don't accept them.
