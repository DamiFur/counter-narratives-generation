 I don't understand how you can be so mean to people who don't speak your native language. Do you live in Canada? Are you a citizen? Are you an immigrant? Do you have a job? Do you own a house? Do you speak a different language? Do you know if you're a citizen or not? Do you want to be a citizen of another country? Do you think you're better than someone who doesn't speak their native language? If you're not a citizen, don't you think you should be able to live anywhere? If you don't want to speak another language, you shouldn't be living anywhere.
