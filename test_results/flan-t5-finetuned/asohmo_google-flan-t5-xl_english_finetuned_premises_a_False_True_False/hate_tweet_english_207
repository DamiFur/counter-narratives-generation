@user tough decisions mean easy ones ban those families who supported isis in germany they murdered many and if you do not learn from recent events like mass immigration rises in rape and crime family isis deserve no return to the country the
 I don't understand how you can justify banning families who supported Isis in Germany if you don't know anything about them. If you do, you're just wasting your time. You don't need to know anything about the families you're banning. You just need to know that they murdered many and if you do not learn from recent events like mass immigration rises in rape and crime family isis deserve no return to the country the.
