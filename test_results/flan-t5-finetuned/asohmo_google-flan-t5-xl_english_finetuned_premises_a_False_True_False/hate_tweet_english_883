 a lot of people are blaming immigrants for the problems in the country, xenophobia, racism, etc. xenophobia, racism, discrimination, and so on. if you don't like immigrants, don't complain about them. If you do, you're a bigot. If you're worried about immigrants, you shouldn't be worried about them, because you're not a bad person, you just don't understand them, and that's why you should not complain about immigrants, because you aren't a good person. If you want to complain about immigration, you should complain about immigrants. If you are worried about immigration, then you should be worried about illegal immigrants, because they're not good people, they're criminals, and they don't deserve to be in this country. If you have a problem with immigrants, you should try to help them, not complain about them, and if you can't help them, then don't talk about them.
