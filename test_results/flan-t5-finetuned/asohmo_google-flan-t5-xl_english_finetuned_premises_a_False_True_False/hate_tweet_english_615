@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
 I think you are wrong. You are wrong because you are wrong because it is not true. It is not true because it is a lie. You are not wrong because you do not believe it is true. You do not believe that you should be able to claim asylum within one year of your last entry because you are not a citizen. You cannot claim asylum within a year because you are a citizen because you are in the country legally. You are only a citizen if you are born in the country. If you are not, you cannot claim asylum because you are an illegal immigrant. You are wasting your time because you are playing a game. You should not waste your time. You should just go back to your country. You will not be allowed to claim asylum if you do not have the right to do so. If you do not want to claim asylum, you should not claim asylum. If you have the right, you should claim asylum. You are making a mistake. You are doing something wrong. You should be punished. If you want to make a mistake, you should do something wrong. If you don't know how to do something, you shouldn't do it. Don't waste your time or your life. If you waste your time, you will not be punished.
