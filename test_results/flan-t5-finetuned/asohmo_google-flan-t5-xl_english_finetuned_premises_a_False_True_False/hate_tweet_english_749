problem for the pm re johnson is that a person who sent round vans telling immigrants to go home is not in a position to lecture anyone on racism the lesson of which is: if you pander theyll take everything you give them and keep pushing for more
 if you don't want to be a racist, don't send out vans telling immigrants to go home. if you do, you're not in a position to lecture anyone on racism.
