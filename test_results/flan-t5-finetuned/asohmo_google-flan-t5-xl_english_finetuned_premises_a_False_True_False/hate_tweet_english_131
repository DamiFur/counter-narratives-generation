@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
 You are right, there are no refugees, they are economic migrants, and they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap. There are no "asylum seekers" who are refugees. There are only "economic migrants/invaders" who are invaders, who are a "disaster" for those countries that allow it to happen.
