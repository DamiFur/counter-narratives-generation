 I don't think that's a good idea. It's not fair to the poor, and it's unfair to the taxpayers who are paying for it. If you don't like it, don't do it. That's what I'm saying. Stop letting foreigners live off the taxpayers. Stop importing the worlds poor if they can't take care of themselves. Stop allowing foreigners to live off u s taxpayers. Send them back, send them back. Don't let them live off us taxpayers.
