 I don't understand why you are so upset about the wall. You don't have to build it, you don't need to, it doesn't make any sense, it's a waste of money, and it's not necessary. There are many ways to build a wall, and none of them are better than the ones you're proposing. If you're going to build one, don't make excuses for why it shouldn't be there.
