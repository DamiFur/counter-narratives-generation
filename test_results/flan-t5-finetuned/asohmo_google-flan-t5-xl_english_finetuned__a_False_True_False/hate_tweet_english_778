 aaaah, that's what I'm talking about. I'm not sure how many people are "infiltrating" the country, but it's a lot. It's not like they're "invading" the country. They're invading a country that's not theirs, and they're not going anywhere. They don't have the right to be here, and they shouldn't be in our country. That's why they're in our country, and that's why we need to do something about it. I don't know how many "invaders" there are, but I know that there are millions.
