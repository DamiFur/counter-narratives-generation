norway: migrant quality not quantity "based on the idea that the welfare state has limited resources 1) immigration must be limited "https://t co/tgumbymdn6
 I don't think it's a bad idea to have migrant quality not amount, it's just that the welfare state has a limited amount of resources, so immigration should be based on the quality of immigrants, not the amount of immigrants.
