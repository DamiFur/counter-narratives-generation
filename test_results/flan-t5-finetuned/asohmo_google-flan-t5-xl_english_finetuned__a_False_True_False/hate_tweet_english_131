 I don't know what you're talking about, but a lot of people don't seem to understand that immigrants are not refugees, they are invaders. They are economic migrants. They are not "asylum seekers". They are immigrants. They are immigrants, and they are not refugees. They are a disaster for the countries that allow this to happen.
