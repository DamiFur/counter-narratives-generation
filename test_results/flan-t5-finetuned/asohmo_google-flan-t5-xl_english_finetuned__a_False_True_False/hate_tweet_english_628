canada is an immigrant country dont change it to refugee country please
 I don't think it's fair to change it because it's a country of immigrants, not refugees. There are a lot of immigrants in Canada. There are more immigrants than refugees in Canada. We are a country where immigrants are welcome. We don't discriminate against immigrants, nor do we discriminate against refugees. We welcome immigrants, but we don't welcome refugees. We are not a "refugee" country, we are an "immigrant" country. There are many immigrants in Canada, but not many refugees. There is a huge difference between immigrants and refugees.
