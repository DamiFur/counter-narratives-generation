regardless of intent the term " undocumented immigrant " is incorrect because illegal aliens are foreigners (i e aliens ) who are unlawfully present in the united states (i e illegal) https://t co/aarjtduwya https://t co/hkrv7mpzok
 I don't think you're right. There is no "undocumented immigrant". There is a "illegal immigrant" who is not a "foreigner" who is unlawfully present in the U.S., and there is no "illegal" immigrant who is not an "aliens".
