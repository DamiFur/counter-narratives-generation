@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
 If you are a citizen, you can claim asylum within one year of your last entry. If you are an illegal, you can only claim asylum within the first year of your entry, if you were born in the US, you cannot claim asylum. If you were born anywhere else, you are not eligible to claim asylum.
