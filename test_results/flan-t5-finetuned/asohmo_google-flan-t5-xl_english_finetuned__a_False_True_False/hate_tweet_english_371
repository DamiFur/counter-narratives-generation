eu to migrants: go home and stay home https://t co/kbucjy2mrq
 I don't understand why the EU is implying that immigrants should go home and stay home. If you don't want them to, why are you implying they should? Why are you suggesting that they should go home? Why do you want them to go home? What are you suggesting? Are you suggesting that immigrants should be forced to go home and not be able to go anywhere else? Why don't you just say "go home and stay at home"? That's better than implying immigrants should go back to where they came from.
