@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
 I don't know how to say it, but if you don't like it, don't say it. If it's true, then it's not true. If it is not true, then you should not say it. You don't have to say it if it doesn't make sense to you. If it makes sense to you, then it is true. If not, then don't tell it. If you do, you'll just end up sounding like a xenophobe. If you say something, then you'll end up looking like a hypocrite. If you're going to say something, you should at least try to make sense of what you're saying.
