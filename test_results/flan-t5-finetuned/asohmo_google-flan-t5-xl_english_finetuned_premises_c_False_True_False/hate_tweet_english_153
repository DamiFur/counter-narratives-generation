comparatively our own inner city youth & fellow americans live like 3rd class citizens while illegals are housed at ice centers that rival the best elementary schools & college dorms in the country hashtag buildthatwall @user @user @user @user @user
 I don't understand why you're so negative about immigrants. Are you implying that they're a threat to the country? Do you think that's a good thing? I'm sure that you don't think that immigrants are a threat, but if you think that they are, you're wrong. It's not a threat because they aren't a threat. They're not a danger because they don't have a right to be here.
