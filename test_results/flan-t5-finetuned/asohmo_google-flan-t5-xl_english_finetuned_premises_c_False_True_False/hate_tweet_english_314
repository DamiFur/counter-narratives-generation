 I don't understand what you're trying to say, but it sounds like you have a problem with immigrants. Are you trying to say that immigrants are a burden to the country? Or are you implying that immigrants are not a burden? Are you suggesting that immigrants don't have a right to be in the country? Are you saying that immigrants shouldn't be allowed to come to the country, but that they should be deported? Or that they shouldn't have the right to be here?
