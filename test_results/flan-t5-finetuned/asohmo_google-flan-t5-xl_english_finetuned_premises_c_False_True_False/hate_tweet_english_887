 I don't think that's what he's saying. It's that he thinks it's a good idea to build a wall. That's not what he said. He's saying that he doesn't like the idea of building a wall, but that it's not a bad idea to build one. What he said is that he likes the idea of a wall because it's better than no wall. That doesn't make sense to me.
