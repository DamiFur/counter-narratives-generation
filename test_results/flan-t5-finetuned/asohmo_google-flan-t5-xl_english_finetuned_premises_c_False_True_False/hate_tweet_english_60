 I think you're being paranoid. I don't think it's a good idea to be paranoid about something you don't understand. It's not a good thing to do. You're paranoid because you're worried about something that doesn't make sense to you. It isn't a bad thing to worry about something that makes sense to you, but it's not something you should worry about. You shouldn't worry about it. You should be worried about something you understand.
