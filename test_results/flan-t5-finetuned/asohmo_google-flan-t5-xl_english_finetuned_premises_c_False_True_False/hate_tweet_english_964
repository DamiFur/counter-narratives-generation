 I don't think it's the right thing to do, but it's something that needs to be done. I just don't understand why it's so important that they're not able to see a u.s. city. It doesn't make sense that they should be able to live in a city that doesn't have a trump olympics in it. It makes no sense that they shouldn't be allowed to live there.
