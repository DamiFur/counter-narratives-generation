" the ngo rescueship lifeline will now go to malta this is the wrong signal for all the humancatcher from the ngos the crew should send into jail because the have ignored the law and the refugees should be brought back to libya https://t co/hp1yvydepf"
 I don't understand why you're implying that the ngos should be sent to jail. It's not their fault that they haven't obeyed the law, it's that they are trying to do something that doesn't abide by the law, and they're trying to do it in a way that's not in the best interests of the refugees. It doesn't matter what the law says, if they don't do it, they shouldn't be allowed to do it. That's what they're doing.
