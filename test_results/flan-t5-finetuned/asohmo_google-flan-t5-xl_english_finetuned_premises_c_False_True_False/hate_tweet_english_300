iranians either entered via greece or serbia which recklessly grants visas to iranians some iranians now fly into serbia ðÿ‰then leave for richer state in eu indirect support of illegal migration must end or others must impose sanctions on serbia to adjust attitude @user https://t co/pzhlgojaxc
 I don't understand why you're making such a big deal out of the fact that a lot of iranians are leaving for the eu. It's not like they're going to greece, they're not going to sri land, they aren't going to be able to get a swedish visa, they don't have a grexit, they haven't got a xenophobia, they just don't want to leave
