@user will islam ever be at peace with its self as it goes to war with itsel f no wonder uk people do not accept its refugees
 I don't understand what you mean by "no wonder"... you don't accept refugees if you think they're not going to accept you. You don't have to accept them if they don't want to accept you, but if they do accept you, they will accept you if you accept them. You are not accepting them because you think they are not accepting you, you are accepting them because they are accepting you. You accept them because you accept them, and they accept you because they accept you.
