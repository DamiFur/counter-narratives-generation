@user time to start firing judges who dont detain immigrants so @user can deport if he was detain and not given a bond that citizen would be alive
 I don't think it's time to start firing judges who don't detain immigrants. That's not what I'm saying. I'm just saying that if he was detained and not given a bond that citizen would be alive.
