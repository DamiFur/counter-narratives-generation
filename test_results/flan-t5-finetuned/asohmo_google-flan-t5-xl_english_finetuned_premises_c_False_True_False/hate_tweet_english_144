 I don't think that's what you were trying to say, but it's true that black people are against their pope, and that they don't want to lose their sheep. That's why they are against him. It's a fact. It doesn't matter if you're black or not, if you don't have a pope, you're not a "sheep". That doesn't make you a hypocrite, it just means that you're a xenophobe.
