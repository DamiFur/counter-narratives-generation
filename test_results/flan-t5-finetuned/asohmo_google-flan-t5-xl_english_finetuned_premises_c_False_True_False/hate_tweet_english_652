@user " can you think of a place that has been improved by mass immigration or the movements of large numbers of refugees ?" "not one the immigration policies in europe are a disaster youre destroying europe youre destroying the culture√¢
 I think you're a little too snooty. I don't think it's true that you're "destroying" Europe, it's that you are destroying the culture. You're destroying it because you don't want people to be able to live there.
