@user and this is exactly how it should be in england crime is low in slovakia etc but all the scumbags come to to commit crimes as they know they can get away with it - they never return hashtag stop immigration
 It is not true that crime is low in other countries, nor does it have to do with immigration. In fact, it is not even close to being true.
