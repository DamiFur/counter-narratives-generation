regardless of intent the term " undocumented immigrant " is incorrect because illegal aliens are foreigners (i e aliens ) who are unlawfully present in the united states (i e illegal) https://t co/aarjtduwya https://t co/hkrv7mpzok
 I don't see the relationship between "undocumented" and "illegal". Neither do I see the relation between "illegal" and "inmigrant".
