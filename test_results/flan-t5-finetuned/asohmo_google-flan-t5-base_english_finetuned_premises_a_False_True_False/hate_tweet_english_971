" spoken like a true globalist a borderless one world government has always been their goal no borders means social mayhem the more chaos they foment the more the public will demand an all powerful superstate ordo ab chao (out of chaos order) is their motto hashtag buildthatwall"
 I don't see the relationship between "social mayhem" and a globalist government. There is no relationship between "a borderless one world government" and the public's demand for a superstate.
