@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
 I don't see the relationship between dogs in america and immigrants, nor do I see the relation between dogs in mexico and immigrants.
