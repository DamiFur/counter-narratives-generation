for all the people holding up signs regarding illegal immigrants hand them each a bill to pay the cost of how much these people take from the american taxpayer and i bet they would take down their signs and go home
 I don't understand the relationship between immigrants and how much they take from the American taxpayer. What do you mean by "how much these people take from the american taxpayer"?
