@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
 Refugees are people fleeing war and hunger. They are not economic migrants or invaders, they are just people looking for a better life.
