@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
 I don't think that is true, if you are in the U.S. illegally you are not allowed to claim asylum, you can only claim asylum within one year of your last entry, and you can't claim asylum more than once a year.
