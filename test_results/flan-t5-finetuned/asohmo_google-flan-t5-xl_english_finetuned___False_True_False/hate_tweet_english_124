@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
 You are wrong. You are implying that immigrants do not have a right to a country. They have a country or they wouldn't be immigrants.
