@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
 If they claim asylum within one year of their last entry, they're not eligible for asylum. If they have been in the country for years, they are not eligible to claim asylum.
