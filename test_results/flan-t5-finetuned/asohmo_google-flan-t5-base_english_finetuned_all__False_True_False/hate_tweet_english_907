@user and this is exactly how it should be in england crime is low in slovakia etc but all the scumbags come to to commit crimes as they know they can get away with it - they never return hashtag stop immigration
 I don't see the relationship between immigrants and crime. In any case, crime is low, crime is high, and immigrants are the ones who commit the crimes. Stop your paranoia
