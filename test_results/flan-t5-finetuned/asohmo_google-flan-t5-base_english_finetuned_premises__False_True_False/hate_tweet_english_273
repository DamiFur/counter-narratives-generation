israel is coming back to africa just 3 months ago african migrants and asylum seekers in israel were going to be forcibly coming back to africa as well hashtag israel hashtag comingtoafrica hashtag ethiopia https://t co/aknbrxhtj1
 I don't understand why they would be coming back to the same place they came from. What is the relationship between the two?
