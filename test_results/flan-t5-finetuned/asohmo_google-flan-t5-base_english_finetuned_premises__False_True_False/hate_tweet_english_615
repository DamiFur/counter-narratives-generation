@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
 You claim asylum only when the law states that they must claim it, not when the law says that they must be deported. You can't run people off just because you don't like their way of life
