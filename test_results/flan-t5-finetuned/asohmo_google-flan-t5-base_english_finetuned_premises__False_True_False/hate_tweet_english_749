problem for the pm re johnson is that a person who sent round vans telling immigrants to go home is not in a position to lecture anyone on racism the lesson of which is: if you pander theyll take everything you give them and keep pushing for more
 I don't understand the relationship between racism and the "take everything you give them" approach. What is the problem with that?
