@user stop being spineless and tell the eu its our country and stop migrants dictating to us via eu
 I don't think you're being a spineless tweep. You're just a xenophobe. You don't have a problem with immigrants, you just don't like them. It's a matter of opinion. You can say what you want, but you can't do anything about it. Stop being spineless and tell the eu it's our country and stop migrants dictating to us via eu.
