@user @user agree with your idea to use the army to build the wall do it hashtag buildthatwall hashtag buildthewall
 I don't agree with that idea, but I do agree with the idea of building the wall. That's what it's all about. It's not about building the wall, it's about building a wall that protects us from xenophobia, racism, and bigotry. We don't need a wall, we don't want a wall. We need to build a wall to protect us from each other, not against each other, and that's why it's important to build the wall.
