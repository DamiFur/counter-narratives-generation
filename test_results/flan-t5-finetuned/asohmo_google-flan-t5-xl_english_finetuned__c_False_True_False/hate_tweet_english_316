@user cameron is a coward he attacks the poor yet again because of immigration the numbers dont add up we need to get out now
 I don't know if it is a coward or a xenophobe, but I believe that he is trying to make sure that the numbers don't add up, and that he doesn't attack the poor, but that he does not attack the poor.
