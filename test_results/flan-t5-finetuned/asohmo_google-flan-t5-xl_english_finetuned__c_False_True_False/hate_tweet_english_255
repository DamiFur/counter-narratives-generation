 I don't understand why you're sneering. It's not that you don't like immigrants, it's that you think they're not that important to you. That's not what you're saying. You're implying that they're important to you, and that you should not care about them. That doesn't make you a racist, it just makes you a xenophobe. You don't care about them, and you should not, because you're not a racist.
