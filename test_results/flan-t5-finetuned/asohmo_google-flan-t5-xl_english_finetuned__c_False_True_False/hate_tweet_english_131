@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
 ah, that's true, a lot of them don't have a job, they're just looking for a better life, and they don't care if they're not a refugee, they just don't give a s**t about where they're from, or where they came from, or why they're there, or what they're doing, or anything.
