 I don't understand what you are trying to say. Are you trying to say that there should be a rtd judge in every state in India? That's not what I'm saying. What I'm trying to say is that there should not be a judge at every state, but that a judge should be in every state, and that he or she should visit every state and visit every state's camps, and ensure that all illegal migrants and people with expired visas are deported.
