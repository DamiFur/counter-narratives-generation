 if you don't believe me, you can see that a lot of people don't want you as a president, but they don't necessarily want you to be the president, they just don't like you. if you want to be president, you have to have a good relationship with the president, and you have to be able to work with him. he's a great guy, but he isn't going to be president. he doesn't know how to work with a president.
