@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
 I don't understand why you think that. It doesn't make sense to me. If they were refugees why not stop at Turkey like the real refugees? Insisting that they should be able to get food, shelter, and other basic things.
