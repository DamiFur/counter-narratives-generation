 I don't know why you're trying to imply that I'm a racist, but I think you're being sarcastic. It's not a racist retweet, it's a sarcasm. It doesn't make me racist, it makes me a xenophobe, it doesn't mean I'm racist, it just means I'm biased against you. That's how I feel about you. You're a racist because you don't agree with me. You don't like me because you think I'm white. You think I'd be a good president if I were a black man. You think a black president would be a better president than a white one. You think you'd be better than a black one if you were a muslim. You think it would be okay if I didn't vote for you. You think that if I voted for you, you wouldn't have voted for me. You think your country would be better if you didn't exist.
