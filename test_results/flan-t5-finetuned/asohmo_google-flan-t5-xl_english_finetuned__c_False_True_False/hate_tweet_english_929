@user @user string him up to show the message that you will pay for your crimes in a country where you are not supposed to be in hashtag buildthatwall we are losing our legal citizens to those who should not be here in the first place if they werent here we would still have our loved ones
 I think you are paranoid. You are not a normal human being. You should not be in this country. You are a criminal. You should be in jail. You should have to pay for your crimes. You are an illegal immigrant. You have no right to be here. You should go back to your country. You don't have a right to be in the country where you are. You should return to your country where you came from. You should pay for the crimes you have committed. You should lose your legal citizenship if you don't believe in the rule of law.
