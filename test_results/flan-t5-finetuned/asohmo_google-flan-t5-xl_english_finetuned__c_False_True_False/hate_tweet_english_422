 I'm not sure if you're trying to be snarky or if you just want to make a point. I think you're making a point that illegal immigration is a problem for Hispanian people, African Americans, and the rest of us. It's not a problem only for them, it's for all of us. I don't think it's a problem primarily for them, but for everyone. It doesn't matter who you are, where you're from, what you look like, what you believe in, what you're a part of, what you don't believe in, where you come from, or what you do for a living. If you care about those things, you shouldn't be complaining about them. You should be focusing on what you can do to make things better for them. That's what you should be doing, not complaining about what you can't do.
