@user tough decisions mean easy ones ban those families who supported isis in germany they murdered many and if you do not learn from recent events like mass immigration rises in rape and crime family isis deserve no return to the country the
 I don't understand what you're saying. Are you saying that rape and crime are a problem? Are you suggesting that it's a problem in your country? Are you implying that it is a problem everywhere? Maybe you're trying to make a political point, not a factual one. Maybe you just don't get it. I'm not sure if you understand what I'm trying to say, but if you don't, you're missing the point. You're making a political argument, not an factual one, and you're making it up as you go along. If you're implying something, you should be able to back it up with proof. If you are implying a fact, you should have proof of it. If you can't, then you shouldn't be implying anything at all. If you do, then you're just making it up. You don't have proof, and if you do, you have no proof. You just made it up. It's not proof, it's opinion. You can't back it up, and it's not fact, and it doesn't make sense.
