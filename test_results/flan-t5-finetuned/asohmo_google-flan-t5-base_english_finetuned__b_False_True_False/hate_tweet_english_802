@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
 Refugees are people seeking to make a living. They are not posing as economic migrants, they are just looking for a place to live
