 omg that is so true, migrant is a problem, not a solution, xenophobia is a serious problem, terrorism is a real problem, and terrorism is not only a problem for a few, it is a global problem, it affects all people, no matter where they are from, if they are a migrant, a refugee or a smuggler, they are all criminals, criminals are criminals
