for all the people holding up signs regarding illegal immigrants hand them each a bill to pay the cost of how much these people take from the american taxpayer and i bet they would take down their signs and go home
 omg that is a terrible idea. if they had to pay a bill to pay for how much they take from the american taxpayer they would take down their signs and go home.
