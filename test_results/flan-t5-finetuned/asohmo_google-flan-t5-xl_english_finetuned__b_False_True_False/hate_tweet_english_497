@user i just read the guy that broke into many homes including chef jaime oliver was let go but dont call a refugee a rapefugee or the soros sponsored police of the uk will not let you go
 What a vile and hateful thing to say. I don't know anyone who would call a refugee a rapefugee, but that doesn't mean they aren't rapists.
