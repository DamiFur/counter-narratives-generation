"""@user @user @user it may have to do with plain honest speech so many politicians have the """political speech""" bug theyre accustomed to stating what people want to hear & not what they need to like saying it is hashtag fucktarded to believe the mass hashtag refugee / hashtag rapefugee immigration was good is idiodic"" "
 I don't know, I'm not a politician, but I think it's a cynical way of looking at things. It is fucking fucktared to believe that the mass immigration of refugees / rapefugees is a good thing. It's not a bad thing, it's just not a good idea.
