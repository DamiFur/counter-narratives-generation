meanwhile in europe nobody speaks the truth that all of the potential millions of migrants and refugees can not be taken into the euro zone former colonial powers like france &amp britain are not without guilt in the creation of the mess that is most of the african continent today
 ooo, that is an enlightening remark. i don't know if it is true or not, but a migrant is not a refugee, he is escaping from a war, a disease, a war criminal, a terrorist, a rapist, a murderer, a drug lord, a criminal.
