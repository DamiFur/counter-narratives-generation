@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
 I don't understand how you can claim asylum if you've been in the US for years. You should have to claim asylum within one year of your last entry.
