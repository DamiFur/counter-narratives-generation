@user i just read the guy that broke into many homes including chef jaime oliver was let go but dont call a refugee a rapefugee or the soros sponsored police of the uk will not let you go
 It is not true that a refugee is a rapist, but it is not the same as a migrant. Refugees are not rapists, they are refugees. You can't call them a "rapist" if you don't recognize them.
