@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
 I don't think it's true that immigrants are "asylum seekers" or that economic migrants are "invaders". That doesn't make them a disaster, it's just that they don't seem to be a threat to the host countries.
