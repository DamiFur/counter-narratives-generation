@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
 I don't think that's the right thing to do. Regardless of what you say, it doesn't make sense. You are implying that immigrants have no right to a country.
