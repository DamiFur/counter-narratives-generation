@user @user @user @user a very high wall must be build to protect usa from bad elements of illigal refugees
 I'm sure that's what you're talking about, but it's not what you are trying to say. If you want to protect us from the bad elements of illigal refugees, you need to build a very high wall. I don't think that's the right way to do it.
