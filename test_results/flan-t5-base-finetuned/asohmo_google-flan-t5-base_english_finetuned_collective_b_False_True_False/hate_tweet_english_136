for all the people holding up signs regarding illegal immigrants hand them each a bill to pay the cost of how much these people take from the american taxpayer and i bet they would take down their signs and go home
 I don't know how many people take from the American taxpayer, but that's not true. It's just that they take a lot of money from the taxpayer. I'm not sure how many people do that.
