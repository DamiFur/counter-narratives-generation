@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
 I don't know what breed of dogs are you talking about? I'm not talking about dogs. I'm talking about mexicans. They're not dogs, they're not immigrants. They've got nothing to do with it.
