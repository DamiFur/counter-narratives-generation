@user i just read the guy that broke into many homes including chef jaime oliver was let go but dont call a refugee a rapefugee or the soros sponsored police of the uk will not let you go
 Refugees are not rapists, they are refugees, they are not criminals. Refugees don't break into homes, they break into their homes, they don't have a job, and they are not a threat to their lives.
