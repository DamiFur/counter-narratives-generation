 Immigration is not a hate speech. Immigration is a crime. Immigration is not the only thing that is hateful. Immigration is the only way to solve the problem. The problem is that immigrants don't have the right to live in the U.S. I don't know if that's true or not, but it's not the only way that immigrants are treated. Immigration is just a hate crime.
