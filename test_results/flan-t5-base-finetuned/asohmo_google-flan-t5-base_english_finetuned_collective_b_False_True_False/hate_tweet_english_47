 Immigration is not a bad thing, it's a fact that it's not a good thing to be a racist. Immigration is a problem, not a problem to be an immigration problem. Immigration is not the problem. It's not the problem to be racist. Immigration has nothing to do with racism. Immigration is just a problem. If you don't know anything about immigration, you're not going to believe anything. Immigration is the problem. You don't have anything to do with immigration. Immigration isn't the problem to you. You're just pointing the finger at immigration.
