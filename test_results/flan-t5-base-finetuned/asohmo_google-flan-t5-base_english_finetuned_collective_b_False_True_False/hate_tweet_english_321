 Immigration. It's not true that immigrants are a threat to Europe, but they aren't just a threat. Immigration is not a threat, it's a threat that Europe is fed up with. Immigration is a threat and it's not going to stop the madness. Immigration is the problem. Immigration has nothing to do with it. Immigration isn't a threat but it's just a problem. Immigration is something that Europeans are fed up with and they don't like it.
