@user and this is exactly how it should be in england crime is low in slovakia etc but all the scumbags come to to commit crimes as they know they can get away with it - they never return hashtag stop immigration
 Immigration is not a crime. Immigration is a collective against whom the hate is directed. Immigration is not the same thing as crime. Immigration has nothing to do with crime, it is just a collective of scumbags.
