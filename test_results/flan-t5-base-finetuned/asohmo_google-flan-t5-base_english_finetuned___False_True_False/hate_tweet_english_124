@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
 If you say "immigrants have a country or they wouldn't be immigrants" you mean that they are not immigrants. It's not true that hispanics have the right to a country.
