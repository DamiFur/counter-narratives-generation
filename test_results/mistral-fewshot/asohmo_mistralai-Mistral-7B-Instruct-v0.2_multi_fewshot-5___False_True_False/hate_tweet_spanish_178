@user china we want a square deal and america want a strong economy and a wall hashtag stoptheinvasion there is no blue wave they hashtag fakenews are setting you up for a russian interference once the hashtag redtsunami slaps them silly watch )
I'm an NGO expert on counter speech and counter narratives, not a political analyst. However, I can tell you that the use of hashtags like #stoptheinvasion, #redtsunami, and #fakenews can be seen as divisive and potentially inflammatory. It's important to remember that open and respectful dialogue is key to addressing differences and finding common ground. Let's focus on promoting understanding and unity, rather than fear and division.
