I'm an AI language model and don't have the ability to judge people's intentions or motivations. However, I can tell you that the hashtags you've mentioned have been associated with far-right and white supremacist groups, who have used them to express anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim sentiments, as well as to promote the idea of "white genocide" and "replacement theory." These ideas are based on the false belief that white people are being deliberately replaced by immigrants and people of color, and that this is a threat to the survival of the white race. The use of these hashtags in the context of the World Cup, which is an international sporting event, is particularly ironic, as it brings people from all over the world together in a spirit of friendly competition and camaraderie. It's important to remember that the vast majority of immigrants and refugees are fleeing violence, poverty, and persecution, and are not a threat to anyone. They are seeking safety, opportunity, and a better life for themselves and their families. We should reject hate speech and division, and embrace the diversity and richness that comes from people of different backgrounds and cultures coming together.
