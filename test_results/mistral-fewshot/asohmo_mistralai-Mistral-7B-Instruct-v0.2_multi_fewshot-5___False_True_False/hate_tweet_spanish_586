"Drunken refugees" is a derogatory term that dehumanizes people who have been forced to flee their homes due to war, persecution, or other reasons. It's important to remember that refugees are human beings who deserve dignity, respect, and the opportunity to build a better life for themselves and their families.The idea that it's better for refugees to stay in their home countries, even if those countries are war-torn or dangerous, is a simplistic and short-sighted perspective. The decision to leave one's country is never an easy one, and it's not made lightly. Refugees often have no choice but to leave due to circumstances beyond their control.Moreover, the journey to reach safety and security can be long and dangerous, but it's a risk many refugees are willing to take in order to have a chance at a better life. The alternative – staying in a dangerous or unstable situation – can be even more perilous.Ultimately, the question of whether it's "sad" or "natural" for refugees to leave their countries is a matter of perspective. From the perspective of the refugees themselves, the decision to leave is often a matter of survival and hope for a better future. From a humanitarian perspective, it's our responsibility
