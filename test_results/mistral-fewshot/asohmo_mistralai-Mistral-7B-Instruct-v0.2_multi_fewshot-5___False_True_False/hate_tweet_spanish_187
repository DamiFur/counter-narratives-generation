I'd need more context to understand the specific situation you're referring to. However, in general, it's important to note that the economic impact of undocumented immigrants is a complex issue. While it's true that they may not pay taxes in the same way as citizens, they do contribute to the economy through their labor and consumer spending. Additionally, many studies have shown that the economic benefits of having a larger, more diverse workforce outweigh the costs. It's important for policymakers to consider the full range of economic, social, and human rights implications when making decisions about immigration policy.
