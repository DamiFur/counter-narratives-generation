"Hispanics" are not a monolithic group, and it's important to remember that not all Hispanics hold the same views on illegal immigration. Moreover, the impact of illegal immigration on wages, jobs, and communities is a complex issue with many factors at play. It's also worth noting that African Americans and Hispanics are not in competition with each other; rather, we should be working together to address the root causes of economic inequality and ensure that all communities have access to opportunities and resources. #WalkAway from divisive and oversimplified narratives. #UnitedWeStand.
