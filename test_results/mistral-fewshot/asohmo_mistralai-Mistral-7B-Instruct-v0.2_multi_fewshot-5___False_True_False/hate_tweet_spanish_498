regardless of intent the term " undocumented immigrant " is incorrect because illegal aliens are foreigners (i e aliens ) who are unlawfully present in the united states (i e illegal) https://t co/aarjtduwya https://t co/hkrv7mpzok
"Undocumented immigrants" is a term used to refer to individuals who are present in a country without the necessary legal documentation to be there, but who are not necessarily breaking any other laws. It's a more neutral and respectful term than "illegal alien," which can be seen as derogatory and dehumanizing. The use of the term "alien" itself can be problematic, as it reinforces the idea that immigrants are not truly human or part of the community. It is important to remember that people are more than just their immigration status and that everyone deserves respect and dignity, regardless of their legal status.
