@user a gang of streets sellers ? this is " bbc speak " what u meant to say was third world illegal immigrants hashtag lbc
"Third world" is a term that can be considered outdated and pejorative. It's better to use more precise and respectful terms, such as "immigrants from developing countries" or "migrants from certain regions."Regarding the rest of the tweet, it's important to remember that not all street sellers are immigrants, and not all immigrants are involved in selling on the streets. Let's avoid generalizations and stereotypes.
