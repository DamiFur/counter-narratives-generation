comparatively our own inner city youth & fellow americans live like 3rd class citizens while illegals are housed at ice centers that rival the best elementary schools & college dorms in the country hashtag buildthatwall @user @user @user @user @user
I'd like to remind everyone that it's important to base our opinions on facts and not on stereotypes or misinformation. The living conditions of immigrants in detention centers can vary greatly, and it's not accurate to generalize that they're all living in luxury while American citizens are struggling. Let's focus on finding solutions that address the root causes of poverty and inequality in our communities, rather than scapegoating certain groups. #compassion #factsnotfiction
