I strongly condemn any form of hate speech or discrimination against individuals or groups based on their nationality or immigration status. It's important to remember that everyone has the right to live in peace and dignity, regardless of where they come from or their legal status. Let's focus on promoting understanding, tolerance, and respect for all people. #EndHateSpeech #PromoteLoveNotHate
