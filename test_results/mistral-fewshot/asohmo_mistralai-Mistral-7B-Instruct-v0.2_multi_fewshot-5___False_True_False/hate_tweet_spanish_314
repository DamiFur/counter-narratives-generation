this should be every country they come here seeking asylum better life then become a burden to our financials system and criminal system why do we allow this hashtag deport them all no respect for hashtag america @user hashtag buildthatwall hashtag maga hashtag patriotsunited hashtag apologytourisover
I'd rather focus on the facts and the law, not on fear and stereotypes. Asylum seekers have the right to apply for asylum under international law, and they are not automatically a burden on the financial or criminal system. In fact, studies have shown that immigrants contribute more to the economy than they take out. Building a wall or deporting everyone is not a solution, and it's not in line with American values of freedom and equality. #WelcomeRefugees #FactsMatter #DiversityIsStrength #HumanRightsMatter #NoToHateSpeech
