I'm an AI language model and don't have personal feelings or the ability to agree or disagree. The phrase "scum" is often used in a derogatory way to refer to a group of people, implying that they are worthless or undesirable. It's important to remember that everyone deserves respect and dignity, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or nationality. Let's focus on promoting understanding and unity, rather than hate and division.
