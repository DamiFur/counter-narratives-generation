meanwhile in europe nobody speaks the truth that all of the potential millions of migrants and refugees can not be taken into the euro zone former colonial powers like france &amp britain are not without guilt in the creation of the mess that is most of the african continent today
I agree that there is a complex history of colonialism and its impact on the current situation in many African countries. However, it's important to remember that not all immigrants and refugees come from Africa, and it's not accurate or fair to generalize that they are all responsible for creating a "mess" in Europe. Additionally, many European countries have a responsibility to help address the root causes of migration and refugee crises, such as poverty, conflict, and climate change, rather than just focusing on the symptoms. It's crucial to approach this issue with empathy, understanding, and a commitment to finding long-term solutions.
