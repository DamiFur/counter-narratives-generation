today in tallin: puppets of the financial establishment dream from a new europe with many slaves macron a wordmouth and kern a refugeelover https://t co/yfkd6dsjfm
I'm unable to access the link you've provided, but it seems like you're implying that Macron and Kern have some sort of ulterior motive in their policies towards Europe and refugees. However, there's no evidence to support this claim, and it's important to remember that political leaders have complex motivations and agendas, not all of which can be reduced to simplistic labels like "puppets" or "refugeelover." It's always a good idea to critically evaluate the sources of information and consider multiple perspectives before forming an opinion.
