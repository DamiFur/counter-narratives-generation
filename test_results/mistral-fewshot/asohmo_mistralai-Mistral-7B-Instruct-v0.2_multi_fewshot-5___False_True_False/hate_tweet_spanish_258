I'm unable to access the link you've provided, but I can tell you that Japan does have strict immigration policies and accepts a relatively small number of refugees compared to other countries. However, it's important to note that not all refugees are seeking asylum in Japan, and the country has other ways of welcoming foreigners, such as through work visas and student visas. It's also worth mentioning that Japan's low acceptance rate for refugees doesn't make it unique in the world, as many countries have similar or even more restrictive refugee policies.It's also important to remember that every country has the right to determine its own immigration and refugee policies, and that these policies should be based on human rights principles, including the principle of non-discrimination.Regarding the statement about "gays, negros, sudacas, or moros", it's crucial to reject any form of discrimination and hate speech, and to remember that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic, have the right to live free from discrimination and violence.
