about 3700 refugee medicine doctors are allowed to work in germany in hospitals now they realize that some of them are not on the standard of western medicine and often some buyed the certificats home without knowledge so some patients died https://t co/belfz7m72z
I'm sorry to hear about the concerns regarding the qualifications of some refugee doctors in Germany. It's important to ensure that all medical professionals meet the necessary standards to provide safe and effective care for their patients. However, it's also important to remember that this is not a unique issue to refugee doctors, and there have been cases of doctors with questionable qualifications in other countries and backgrounds as well. The focus should be on addressing the root causes of these issues, such as inadequate training, lack of resources, and inadequate regulatory oversight, rather than stigmatizing an entire group based on their background. Additionally, it is crucial to remember that the vast majority of refugee doctors are highly qualified and have undergone rigorous training in their home countries, and they bring valuable skills and perspectives to the medical field in Germany and beyond.
