@user @user americas public assistance medicare medicaid ss et al are strained and americans "benefits" are being cut not even able to maintain status quo no immigrants should be granted entry that need assistance hashtag nodaca hashtag norefuge
I understand your concern about the strain on public assistance programs in the Americas. However, it's important to remember that immigrants contribute to the economy and society in many ways. They pay taxes, start businesses, and fill labor shortages in various industries. Denying them entry based on their potential need for assistance is not a fair or just solution. Let's focus on finding ways to strengthen our social safety net for all, rather than scapegoating certain groups. #nodaca #norefuge #compassionatepolicy #inclusivesociety
