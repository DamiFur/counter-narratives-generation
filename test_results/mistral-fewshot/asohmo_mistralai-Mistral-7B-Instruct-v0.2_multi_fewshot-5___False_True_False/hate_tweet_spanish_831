"good for bulgaria but their leaders also have responsibility to secure their border to prevent migrants from roaming northward actions must start matching rhetoric in europe this is what makes hashtag orban unique unlike others orban "walks his talk" and is a man of action hashtag hungary https://t co/gxjkizdndo"
"Good for Hungary that its leaders are taking action to secure their borders and prevent the movement of migrants northward. However, it's important to remember that leaders also have a responsibility to do so in a way that respects human rights and international law. This is what sets Hungary's approach apart from others - Orban's actions match his rhetoric. But let's not forget that there are many ways to address migration and border security that don't involve violating people's basic human rights." #Hungary #MigrationPolicy #HumanRights #InternationalLaw
