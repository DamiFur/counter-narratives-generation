"Unbelievable" census data: In CA, 44.6% don't speak English at home; 35.6% in TX, 34.5% in NM, 31.7% in NJ, and 31% in NY. Our schools are getting 100% additional funding for every non-English speaking student. Parents: your job is to stop immigration.This tweet seems to express concern about the number of non-English speakers in certain states and their impact on schools and funding. However, it's important to note that this data doesn't necessarily mean that immigration is the sole cause of this demographic shift. Additionally, the idea that schools should receive less funding for students who speak English as a second language is misguided, as these students often require additional resources to succeed academically. Furthermore, the call to "stop immigration" is not only xenophobic, but it's also a simplistic solution to a complex issue.
