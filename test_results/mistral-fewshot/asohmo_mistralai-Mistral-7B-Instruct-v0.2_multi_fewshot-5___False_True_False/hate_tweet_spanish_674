@user unchecked population &amp migration to cities is biggest evil for dirty india disincentive large families such as withdrawl of sops
"Unchecked population and migration to cities" can indeed be a challenge for many countries, including India. However, it's important to approach this issue with facts and evidence-based solutions, rather than stigmatizing certain groups.Providing incentives for families to have fewer children, such as withdrawal of subsidies, can be one way to address population growth. But it's also crucial to ensure that such policies are implemented in a fair and equitable manner, and that they don't disproportionately affect marginalized communities or exacerbate existing inequalities.Additionally, addressing the root causes of urbanization, such as lack of employment opportunities and inadequate infrastructure in rural areas, can help reduce the pressure on cities and improve living conditions for both urban and rural populations.
