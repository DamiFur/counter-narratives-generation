"Illegal aliens" is a term used to refer to immigrants who enter a country without proper documentation. It's important to remember that people who come to a new country, regardless of their legal status, are human beings with hopes, dreams, and the desire to build a better life for themselves and their families. They are not "stealing" anyone's identity or jobs. Building a wall or stopping illegal immigration won't solve the root causes of why people are leaving their home countries in the first place. And the idea of "America First" or "Americans First" can be divisive and exclusionary. We should strive for a world where all people are treated with dignity and respect, regardless of where they come from.
