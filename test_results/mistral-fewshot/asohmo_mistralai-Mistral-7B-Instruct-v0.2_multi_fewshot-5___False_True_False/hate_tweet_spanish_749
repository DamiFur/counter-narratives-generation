I understand your point, but it's important to remember that actions and words should be judged on their own merit, rather than based on the intentions or past actions of individuals. In this case, it's crucial for leaders to take a strong stance against hate speech and discrimination, regardless of their own past actions or perceived shortcomings.It's also important to recognize that addressing the root causes of racism and discrimination requires a multifaceted approach, including education, policy changes, and community engagement. Simply condemning hate speech is not enough, but it is an important first step in creating a more inclusive and equitable society.As for the quote you provided, it seems to suggest a cynical view of politics and the relationship between politicians and their constituents. While there may be some truth to the idea that pandering to certain groups can be politically advantageous, it is not a justification for engaging in hateful or discriminatory behavior. Rather, it underscores the importance of holding leaders accountable for their words and actions, and of working to create a political climate that values inclusivity and respect for all individuals.
