1. El tema de la migración masiva desde el mundo islámico y las células terroristas es un tema de preocupación para Europa desde el Medio Oriente.2. Pero no sería una guerra de EE.UU. contra Irán que aumentara en lugar de disminuir esa amenaza?Respuesta:It is true that the mass migration from the Islamic world and the presence of terrorist cells pose a significant threat to Europe from the Middle East. However, it is not clear how a U.S. war against Iran would decrease rather than increase that threat. In fact, such a war could potentially lead to an increase in instability and violence in the region, which could in turn lead to more people fleeing their homes and seeking refuge in Europe. Additionally, Iran has been known to support various militant groups, some of which have carried out terrorist attacks in Europe in the past. A war with Iran could potentially embolden these groups and lead to more attacks. It is important to consider all the potential consequences of military action and to explore diplomatic and non-military solutions whenever possible.
