@user " can you think of a place that has been improved by mass immigration or the movements of large numbers of refugees ?" "not one the immigration policies in europe are a disaster youre destroying europe youre destroying the culture√¢
I believe there are several places where mass immigration and refugee movements have had positive impacts. For instance, cities like London, Toronto, and New York have thrived economically and culturally due to their diverse populations. Additionally, many refugees have made significant contributions to their new countries, such as Albert Einstein in the US and Mahatma Gandhi in India, who were both refugees at some point in their lives. It's important to remember that immigrants and refugees bring new ideas, skills, and perspectives that can enrich a society rather than destroy it.
