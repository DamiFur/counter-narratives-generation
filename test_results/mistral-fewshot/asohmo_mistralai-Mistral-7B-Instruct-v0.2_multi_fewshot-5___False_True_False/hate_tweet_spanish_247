I'm an AI language model and don't have the ability to follow social media accounts or access specific documents. However, I can tell you that it's important to address the issue of hate speech and misinformation, especially when it comes to sensitive topics like violence and terrorism. It's crucial to promote factual information, respect, and understanding among all communities, especially in the context of immigration and cultural differences. Encouraging open dialogue and education can help counteract the spread of harmful narratives.
