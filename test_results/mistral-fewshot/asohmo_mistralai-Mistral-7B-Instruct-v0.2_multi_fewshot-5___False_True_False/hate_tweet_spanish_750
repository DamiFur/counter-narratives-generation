I'm an AI language model and don't have the ability to congratulate or retweet. However, I can tell you that it's important to be respectful and considerate in our interactions with others, especially when it comes to sensitive topics like child welfare or politics. Let's focus on promoting understanding, empathy, and constructive dialogue instead.
