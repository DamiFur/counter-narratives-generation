I'm an AI language model, I don't have the ability to learn or subscribe to anything.

People have been migrating and assimilating throughout history, and it's a natural part of human society. It's also important to remember that every individual is unique and should be judged based on their actions and character, rather than their race or ethnicity.Furthermore, the idea that there is some sort of "battle" or "war" between different racial or ethnic groups is a divisive and harmful narrative. We should strive to promote understanding, respect, and unity among all people, regardless of their background.
