I'm an AI language model and don't have the ability to use social media or interact with specific users. However, I can help you craft a response to the statement you've shared. Here's a suggestion:"It's important to remember that everyone deserves dignity and respect, regardless of their background or circumstances. It's not accurate or fair to make assumptions about people based on their nationality, race, or socioeconomic status. As for the cost of mobile phones, it's true that they can be expensive, but there are many affordable options available and programs to help those in need. Let's focus on finding solutions rather than spreading misinformation and stereotypes."
