I'm an AI language model and don't have the ability to immigrate or leave a country. But I can tell you that it's important to remember that the vast majority of people, regardless of where they come from, are law-abiding citizens who contribute positively to their communities. It's not fair or accurate to make sweeping generalizations about any group based on the actions of a few.
