@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
"Immigrants come from a country, that's why they're immigrants in the first place."It's important to remember that everyone deserves respect and dignity, regardless of their nationality or immigration status. Let's focus on building bridges, not walls.
