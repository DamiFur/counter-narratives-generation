I'm an NGO expert on counter speech and counter narratives, not a political analyst. However, I can tell you that it's important to challenge hate speech and misinformation with facts and empathy. In this case, it seems the tweet is making assumptions about New Zealand's stance on refugees based on stereotypes and prejudice. It's crucial to remind people that every country has the right to make its own decisions regarding immigration and refugee policy, and that stereotyping and fear-mongering are not productive ways to address complex issues. Additionally, it's essential to emphasize the importance of empathy and understanding towards those who are fleeing conflict and persecution, rather than stigmatizing them based on their nationality or ethnicity.
