turkish government must immediately take precautions to protect its borders and find solution for the trouble in syria or else turkey will be a refugee storage in the near future and this is a big threat for our survival hashtag nomore refugee s
I understand your concern about the refugee situation in Syria and its potential impact on Turkey. However, it's important to remember that refugees are human beings in need of protection and assistance, not a threat to anyone's survival. It's crucial for the international community to work together to find long-term solutions to the root causes of displacement, such as conflict and instability, and to provide support to host countries and refugees themselves. Let's focus on compassion and solidarity, rather than fear and division. #refugeeswelcome #solidaritynotfear
