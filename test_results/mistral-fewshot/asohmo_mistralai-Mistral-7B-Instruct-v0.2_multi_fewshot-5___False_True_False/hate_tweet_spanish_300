iranians either entered via greece or serbia which recklessly grants visas to iranians some iranians now fly into serbia ðÿ‰then leave for richer state in eu indirect support of illegal migration must end or others must impose sanctions on serbia to adjust attitude @user https://t co/pzhlgojaxc
I'd like to clarify a few things here. First, it's important to note that not all Iranians entering Europe through Greece or Serbia are doing so illegally. Many are fleeing war, persecution, and poverty, and are seeking asylum in Europe in accordance with international law.Second, the idea that granting visas to Iranians is "reckless" is not supported by evidence. In fact, the European Union has strict visa policies in place to ensure that only those who have a legitimate reason to travel to Europe are granted visas.Third, the notion that countries in the EU are providing "indirect support" to illegal migration by not imposing sanctions on Serbia is misguided. Sanctions are not an effective solution to the complex issue of migration, and they would not address the root causes of why people are fleeing their home countries in the first place.Instead, a more productive approach would be to work with countries of origin and transit to address the underlying causes of migration, such as conflict, poverty, and lack of opportunities. This could include providing humanitarian aid, investing in education and economic development, and working to create safe and legal channels for migration.It's also important to remember that the vast majority of migrants are not criminals or terror
