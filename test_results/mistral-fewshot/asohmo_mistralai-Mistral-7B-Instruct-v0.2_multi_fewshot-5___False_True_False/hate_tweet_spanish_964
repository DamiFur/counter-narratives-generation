I'd like to remind everyone that it's important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their immigration status. The use of derogatory language and hateful hashtags does not contribute to a productive conversation on this complex issue. Let's focus on finding solutions that uphold human rights and promote social cohesion. #Compassion #HumanRights #ImmigrationReform #DignityForAll
