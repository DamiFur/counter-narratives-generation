@user @user agree with your idea to use the army to build the wall do it hashtag buildthatwall hashtag buildthewall
I'm an NGO operator and I don't support hate speech or violence. Building a wall and using the army to do it is not a solution to any problem, and it's not a productive way to address differences or conflicts. Let's focus on dialogue, understanding, and finding peaceful solutions instead. #buildbridgesnotwalls
