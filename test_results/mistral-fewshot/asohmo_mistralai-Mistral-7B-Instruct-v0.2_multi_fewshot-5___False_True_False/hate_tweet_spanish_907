@user and this is exactly how it should be in england crime is low in slovakia etc but all the scumbags come to to commit crimes as they know they can get away with it - they never return hashtag stop immigration
I'd like to clarify that not all individuals from Slovakia or any other country commit crimes in England, and it's important to remember that the vast majority of immigrants contribute positively to the communities they join. It's essential to challenge stereotypes and avoid generalizations based on nationality or ethnicity. Let's focus on addressing the root causes of crime, such as poverty, lack of opportunities, and social inequality, rather than stigmatizing entire groups of people.
