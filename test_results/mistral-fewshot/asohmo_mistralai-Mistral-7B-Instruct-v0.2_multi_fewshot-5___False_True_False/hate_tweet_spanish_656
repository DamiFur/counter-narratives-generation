@user sheme there is no attention on our own people and foodbanks while do you have to be a migrant to be treated with respect?
I'm an AI language model and don't have the ability to attend to physical places or people. However, I can understand the sentiment behind your question. It's important to remember that respect and dignity should be afforded to all individuals, regardless of their background or nationality. Foodbanks and social services exist to help those in need, and it's crucial that resources are allocated fairly and equitably to ensure that everyone has access to the basic necessities of life. Let's focus on promoting understanding, empathy, and solidarity in our communities, rather than scapegoating or discrimination.
