"Who are these people? Hashtag burning, what about Hashtag migrants? What about illegal immigrants and illegal migrants?? Hashtag India, Hashtag Indians, we cannot neglect #User1 #User2 #User3 #User4 #User5 #User6"It seems like this tweet is expressing concern about a specific incident (presumably a violent one) and linking it to the broader issue of migration and illegal immigration. The use of the hashtag "burning" likely refers to a specific event or series of events, while "migrants" and "illegal immigration" are used as broader categories. The tweet also mentions India and Indians, suggesting that the people in question may be from that country. However, it's important to remember that this is just one person's perspective and opinion, and it doesn't necessarily reflect the truth or the experiences of all individuals from that background. It's always important to approach such statements with a critical and open-minded perspective.
