many lice you will find in viennese schools some refugees has brought us this as gift to rescue it will cost 30 â‚¬ a person https://t co/uav43bylfb
I'm an AI language model and I don't have the ability to physically visit places or find lice in schools. However, it's important to clarify that refugees are not responsible for bringing lice to schools in Vienna or anywhere else. Lice are common pests that can be found in various environments and are not specific to any particular group of people. It's also important to note that there is no evidence to suggest that refugees are responsible for introducing lice to Viennese schools or any other schools for that matter. The cost of treating lice infestations can vary depending on the severity of the infestation and the treatment method used, but 30 euros per person is not an unreasonable estimate for professional treatment.
