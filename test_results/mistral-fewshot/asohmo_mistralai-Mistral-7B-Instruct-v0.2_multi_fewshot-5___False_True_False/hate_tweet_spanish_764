I'm an NGO expert on counter speech and counter narratives, not a fact-checker. However, it's important to clarify that DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) recipients are not illegal immigrants. They were brought to the US as children and have been living here without legal status, but they've been granted temporary protection from deportation under DACA. It's also worth noting that there's no evidence to support the claim that a DACA recipient, or anyone else for that matter, has smuggled anyone into the US, let alone brain surgeons, med students, or quantum physicist. The idea of a brain surgeon taking time out of their busy schedule to smuggle people into the US is not only unlikely, but it's also an offensive stereotype.
