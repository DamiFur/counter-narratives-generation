I'm an AI language model and don't have personal experiences or the ability to read specific news articles. However, I can tell you that it's important to avoid making assumptions or spreading misinformation, especially when it comes to sensitive topics like immigration and crime.Regarding the term "rapefugee," it's a derogatory term that has been used to stigmatize refugees and is based on a false stereotype. It's essential to remember that refugees are individuals who have been forced to flee their homes due to violence, war, or persecution, and the vast majority are not criminals or rapists.As for the comment about George Soros and the UK police, there is no evidence to support the claim that Soros has sponsored the UK police or that they are letting certain people go based on their political beliefs. This is a conspiracy theory that has been debunked by fact-checking organizations.It's always important to fact-check information before sharing it and to avoid spreading misinformation or hate speech.
