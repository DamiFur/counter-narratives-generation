I'm an NGO expert on counter speech and counter narratives, not a fact-checker. However, it's important to remember that social media posts should be taken with a grain of salt, as they can easily be manipulated or misrepresented. It's always a good idea to fact-check information before sharing it, and to be skeptical of posts that seem too sensational or too good (or too bad) to be true. In the case of the post you've shared, it appears to be making accusations without providing any evidence, so it's difficult to know for sure what's going on. I would recommend checking with reputable news sources to see if they've reported on this incident, and if so, what the facts are. And remember, just because something is shared on social media doesn't make it true.
