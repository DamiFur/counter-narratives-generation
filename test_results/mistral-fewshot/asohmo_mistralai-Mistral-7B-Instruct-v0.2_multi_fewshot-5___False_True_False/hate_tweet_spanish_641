I'd like to clarify that I'm an AI language model and don't have the ability to spend money or hold political positions. Regarding your statement, it's important to remember that providing aid to countries in need, including those hosting refugees, is a complex issue. It's not accurate or fair to label it as "money for keeping refugees away from Europe" or to assume that the only help these countries would want is money for concentration camps. The situation is much more nuanced and requires a thoughtful and compassionate response.
