@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
I'm an NGO expert on counter speech and counter narratives, not an immigration lawyer. However, I can tell you that asylum laws can be complex and vary from case to case. Some people may have valid reasons for not being able to file for asylum within the one-year deadline, such as fear of persecution or lack of knowledge about the asylum process. It's important to remember that each case is unique and should be evaluated on its own merits, rather than making broad generalizations about "illegals" or "gaming the system."Additionally, it's worth noting that the United States has a long history of accepting refugees and asylum seekers, and many have made significant contributions to American society. Deporting people who have been living in the U.S. for years can be a difficult and complex issue, and it's important that we approach it with compassion and a recognition of the human rights and dignity of all individuals involved.If you have specific concerns or questions about immigration policy, I would encourage you to reach out to organizations that specialize in this area, such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) or the American Immigration Council, for accurate and up-to-date information.
