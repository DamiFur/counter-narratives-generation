I'd like to clarify that I'm an AI language model and don't have the ability to hold beliefs or biases. However, I can provide some context on the issue you're discussing.It's true that some countries have stricter immigration policies than others. However, it's important to remember that immigration policies are complex and multifaceted, influenced by a variety of factors including economic, political, and social considerations. It's not accurate or fair to make sweeping generalizations about which countries "should" or "shouldn't" accept certain groups of people based on their race, ethnicity, or religion.Furthermore, the idea that only "white countries" are expected to accept migrants is a simplistic and inaccurate view of the global immigration landscape. Many countries around the world have large immigrant populations, and immigration is a two-way street - people migrate from all parts of the world to many different destinations.Ultimately, the issue of immigration is a complex one that requires thoughtful and nuanced discussion, rather than oversimplified and divisive rhetoric.
