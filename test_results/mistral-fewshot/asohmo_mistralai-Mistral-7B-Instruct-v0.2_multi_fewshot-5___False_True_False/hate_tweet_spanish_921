I'm an NGO operator and I don't support hate speech or violence. It's important to remember that not all individuals from a certain background or religion hold extremist views, and it's crucial to avoid generalizations and stereotypes. Let's focus on promoting understanding, respect, and peace instead. #SendLoveNotHate #UnityInDiversity #EndHateSpeech. #auspol @user1 @user2 @user3.
