for all the people holding up signs regarding illegal immigrants hand them each a bill to pay the cost of how much these people take from the american taxpayer and i bet they would take down their signs and go home
I'd be happy to help you understand the complex issue of illegal immigration and its impact on the American taxpayer. However, it's important to note that the relationship between illegal immigration and taxpayer costs is not as straightforward as some people make it out to be. Here are some facts to consider:1. Many illegal immigrants pay taxes: Contrary to popular belief, many illegal immigrants do pay taxes. They pay sales taxes, property taxes, and even income taxes through the use of Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs). In fact, according to a report by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, undocumented immigrants paid an estimated $11.8 billion in state and local taxes in 2018.2. They also use public services: It's true that illegal immigrants use some public services, such as emergency rooms and public schools. However, the cost of these services is often offset by the taxes they pay. For example, a study by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found that the net cost of educating an undocumented immigrant is around $500 per student per year, while they contribute around $1,100 in taxes.3. They contribute to the economy: Illegal immigrants also contribute to the American economy through their labor.
