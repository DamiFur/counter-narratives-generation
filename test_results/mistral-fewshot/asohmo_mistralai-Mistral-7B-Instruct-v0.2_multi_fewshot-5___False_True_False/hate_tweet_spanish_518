I agree that historical context is important when discussing complex issues like immigration. However, it's important to note that the situation today is not the same as it was 10 or even 1 hundred years ago. Factors such as globalization, economic conditions, and geopolitical instability have all played a role in the current migration patterns.It's also worth noting that while there may have been "free and open borders" in the past, this does not mean that there were no laws or regulations governing immigration. And even if there were, the circumstances and needs of today's immigrants are vastly different from those of the past.Ultimately, the issue of immigration is complex and multifaceted, and it requires a thoughtful and nuanced approach that takes into account both historical context and current realities. It's important that we avoid oversimplifying the issue and instead focus on finding solutions that address the root causes of migration and ensure that immigrants are treated with dignity and respect.
