but i thought hashtag white genocide wasnt real? hashtag deportthemigrants hashtag refugees notwelcome hashtag white pride
"White genocide" is not a real thing. It's a term coined by white supremacist groups to spread fear and hate towards immigrants and people of color. The idea behind it is that white people are being "replaced" by people of other races through immigration and birth rates. This is not based in fact, but rather in fear and prejudice.The hashtags you mentioned, such as #deportthemigrants, #refugeesnotwelcome, and #whitepride, are often used by those who hold racist and xenophobic views and seek to exclude or harm people based on their race or nationality. These views are not only harmful, but also go against the principles of equality and human rights.It's important to remember that all people, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or nationality, have the right to live in safety and dignity, and to be treated with respect and compassion. We should reject hate speech and work towards building a more inclusive and welcoming society for all.
