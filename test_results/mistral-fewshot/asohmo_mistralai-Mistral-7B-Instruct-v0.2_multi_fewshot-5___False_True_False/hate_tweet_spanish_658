I strongly condemn any form of hate speech or discrimination based on race, religion, or nationality. It's important to remember that the vast majority of people, regardless of their background, are peaceful and law-abiding citizens. Let's focus on promoting understanding, respect, and unity among all communities. #EndHateSpeech #PromoteLoveNotHate
