Let me clarify:The hate speech in the tweet is directed towards gays and Marroquíes, accusing them of being involved in fictitious violations. The justification for this hate speech is that there is an obsession with violations on Mierditteráneo Digital, a social media platform. The conclusion of the hate speech is a question asking if gays and Moroccans will be gay, black Sudacas or Moroccans.It's important to note that the accusations of violations are fictitious and have no basis in fact. The hate speech is not only targeting gays, but also Moroccans, and it's using their ethnicity and sexual orientation as a way to dehumanize and stigmatize them.
