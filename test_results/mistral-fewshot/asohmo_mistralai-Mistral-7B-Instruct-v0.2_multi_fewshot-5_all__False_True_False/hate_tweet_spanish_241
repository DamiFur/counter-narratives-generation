| Property associatedwith the collective:violaciones| Justificación:en mierditerráneodigitalandanunpocoobsesionadosconlasviolacioneslasficticias(fact)| Conclusion:denunciarqueungcunmilitarviaronacríade18añosnoquedamuypatriotagaysyunmarroquí¿serángaysnegrosudacasormoros?(fact) This tweet contains hate speech against gays, blacks, and Moroccans, accusing them of being involved in fictitious violations. The justification for this hate speech is that there is an obsession with violations in "mierditterráneo digital," and the conclusion is that a GC and a soldier committed a violation against a 18-year-old, implying that the GC and Moroccan in question may be gay, black, and Sudacan or Moroccan.It's important to clarify that there is no factual basis for the accusations made in this tweet. The idea that there is a disproportionate involvement of certain groups in violent crimes is a harmful stereotype and has no basis in reality. It's essential to challenge such hate speech and promote understanding, respect
