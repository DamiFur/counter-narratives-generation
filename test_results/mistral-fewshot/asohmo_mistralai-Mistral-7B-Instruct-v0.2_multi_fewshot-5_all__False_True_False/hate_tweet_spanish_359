| Property associatedwith the collective:violaciones| Justificación:en mierditerráneodigitalandanunpocoobsesionadosconlasviolacioneslasficticias(fact)| Conclusion:denunciarqueungcunmilitarviaronacríade18añosnoquedamuypatriotagaysyunmarroquí¿serángaysnegrosudacasormoros?(fact) There seems to be a misunderstanding here. Let me clarify:This tweet is expressing concern about a hateful trend on Mierditteráneo Digital, where people are falsely accusing gays, blacks, and Moroccans of violations. The justification is that there is an obsession with false accusations of violations on this platform. The conclusion is a question asking if the accused are gay black Sudacas or Moroccans.Therefore, the collective being targeted with hate is "gays negros Sudacas o Moros," and the property associated with them is "violaciones" (violations).I hope this clears up any confusion. Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.
