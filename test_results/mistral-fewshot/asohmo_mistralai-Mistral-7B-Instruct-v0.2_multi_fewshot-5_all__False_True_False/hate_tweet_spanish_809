The justification for this hate speech is that there is an obsession with violations on the "Mierditterráneo Digital" platform. The conclusion of the hate speech is a question asking if the gays and the Moroccan individual in question are gay, black Sudacas or Moros.It's important to clarify that there is no factual basis to the accusations made in the tweet. The idea that there is a higher prevalence of violations among the LGBTQ+ community and people of Moroccan descent is a harmful stereotype and a form of discrimination. It's essential to challenge and counter such hate speech to promote inclusivity and respect for all individuals, regardless
