| Property associatedwith the collective:violaciones| Justificación:en mierditerráneodigitalandanunpocobesionadosconlasviolacioneslasficticias(fact)| Conclusion:denunciarqueungcunmilitarviaronacríade18añosnoquedamuypatriotagaysyunmarroquí¿serángaysnegrosudacasormoros?(fact) There seems to be a misunderstanding here. I'll clarify:The hate speech in this tweet is directed towards gays and black people from Sudan or Morocco. The justification for the hate speech is that there are people in Mierditteráneo Digital who are obsessed with reporting fictitious violations, and they have reported an incident of a GC and a military man raping an 18-year-old girl. The conclusion drawn from this is that gays from Sudan and Morocco are the ones committing these violations.My response:It's important to clarify that there is no factual basis to the claim being made in the tweet. The idea that certain groups are more prone to committing violations is a harmful stereotype and is not supported
