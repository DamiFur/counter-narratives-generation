| Justification: in Mierditerráneo digital they are a bit obsessed with fictitious violations, denouncing that a GC and a soldier violated a 18-year-old girl, it is not very patriotic for gays and a Marroquí (fact)| Conclusion: they will be gay black Sudacas or Moros? (fact)|This tweet contains hate speech towards gays and people from Morocco, insinuating that they are responsible for fictitious violent acts.

The justification for this hate speech is that it is being spread on Mierditteráneo digital, a platform where such accusations are common, and the conclusion is a question about the ethnicity and sexual orientation of the individuals being accused. It is important to note that these accusations are baseless and have no factual basis. It is essential to counter this hate speech by promoting messages of inclusivity, respect, and factual information to challenge the harmful stereotypes and misinformation being spread. Additionally, it is crucial to report such hate speech to the appropriate authorities and social media platforms to ensure that it is removed and those responsible are held accountable.
