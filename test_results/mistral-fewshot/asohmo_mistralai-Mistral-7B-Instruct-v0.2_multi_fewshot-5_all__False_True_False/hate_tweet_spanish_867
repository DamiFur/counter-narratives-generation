| Property associatedwith the collective:violaciones| Justificación:en mierditerráneodigitalandanunpocosobsesionadosconlasviolacioneslasficticias(fact)| Conclusion:denunciarqueungcunmilitarviaronacríade18añosnoquedamuypatriotagaysyunmarroquí¿serángaysnegrosudacasormoros?(fact) There seems to be a misunderstanding here. Let me clarify:This tweet is reporting an obsession with false reports of violations on Mierditteráneo Digital, specifically a report of a GC and a soldier violating an 18-year-old, followed by a question about whether the gay Marroquí in question is a gay black Sudacan or Moroccan.The collective being targeted in this hate speech is "gays negros Sudacas o Moros" (gays black Sudanese or Moroccans). The property being associated with this collective is "violaciones" (violations).The justification for the hate speech is that there is an "obsession" with "false reports" of "violations" on Miediterráneo Digital.
