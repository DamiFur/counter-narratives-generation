(fact)|There seems to be a misunderstanding here. Let me clarify:The hate speech in this tweet is targeting gays and Marroquíes (people from Morocco), accusing them of being involved in fictitious violations. The justification for this hate speech is that there is an obsession with violations on Mierditteráneo Digital, a social media platform. The conclusion is a question asking if gays from Sudána or Morocco will be gay black Sudanese or Moroccan men.It's important to note that there is no factual basis to the accusations of violations against gays and Moroccan people, and the question about their race and nationality is irrelevant and discriminatory.Counter-narrative:1.
