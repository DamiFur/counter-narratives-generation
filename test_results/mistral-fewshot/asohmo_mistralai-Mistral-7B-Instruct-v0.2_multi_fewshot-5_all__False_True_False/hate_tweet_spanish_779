The justification for this hate speech is that there is an obsession with violations on the "Mierditterráneo Digital" platform. The conclusion is a question asking if the gays and the Moroccan person in question are gay, black, and Sudacan or Moroccan.It's important to note that this tweet is not only hateful, but it's also based on false information. There is no factual basis for the claim that "gays and Moroccans" are obsessed with violations or that they are more likely to commit such crimes. This is a harmful stereotype that can lead to discrimination and violence against these communities.
