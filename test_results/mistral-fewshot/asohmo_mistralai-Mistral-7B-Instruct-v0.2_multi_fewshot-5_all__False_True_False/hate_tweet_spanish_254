The justification for this hate speech is that there is an obsession with violations in Mierditteráneo Digital, a social media platform, and that a GC and a soldier violated a 18-year-old girl, with the implication that the individuals involved were gay and Moroccan. The conclusion of the hate speech is a question asking if they will be gay black Sudacas or Moroccans.It's important to note that the accusations made in the tweet are baseless and there is no evidence to support these claims. It's crucial to challenge and counter such hate speech to prevent the spread of misinformation and harmful stereotypes.
