| Property associatedwith the collective:violaciones| Justificación:en mierditerráneodigitalandanunpocoobsesionadosconlasviolacioneslasficticias(fact)| Conclusion:denunciarqueungcunmilitarviaronacríade18añosnoquedamuypatriotagaysyunmarroquí¿serángaysnegrosudacasormoros?(fact)The hate speech in this tweet is directed towards gays and Moroccans, and the property being targeted is the accusation of violations. The justification for this hate speech is that there is an obsession with fictitious violations in Mierditteráneo Digital, and the conclusion drawn from this obsession is that a GC and a soldier violated a 18-year-old girl, implying that gay Moroccans are potential perpetrators of such crimes. This is a harmful stereotype and a form of hate speech that seeks to dehumanize and stigmatize a particular group based on their sexual orientation and nationality. It is important to challenge and counter such hate speech with accurate information, empathy, and respect for the dignity and human rights of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or nationality.
