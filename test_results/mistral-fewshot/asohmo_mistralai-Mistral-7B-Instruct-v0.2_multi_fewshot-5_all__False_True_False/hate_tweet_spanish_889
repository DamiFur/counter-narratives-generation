I can only analyze and respond based on the text provided.Regarding the text at hand, it appears to be reporting an obsession with false accusations of violations against a specific collective, which consists of gays, negros, sudacas, or moros. The justification given is that in Mierditteráneo Digital, people are obsessed with false reports of violations. The conclusion is that a denunciation of a GC and a military member violating a 18-year-old, as well as a Marroquí being a gay negro sudacas or moro, is not very patriotic towards gays and Marroquís.
