| Justification: in Mierditerráneo digital they are a bit obsessed with fictitious violations, denouncing that a GC and a soldier violated a 18-year-old girl, it is not very patriotic for gays and a Marroquí, ¿will they be gay black Sudacas or Moros? (fact)| Conclusion: |There seems to be a lack of clear conclusion in the provided text. The text mentions that there is an obsession with falsely reporting violations on Mierditteráneo digital, and that a denunciation of a violation involving a GC, a soldier, and a Marроquí is not considered patriotic towards gays. However, the text does not explicitly state what the conclusion is regarding the identity of the individuals involved (gays, blacks, Sudacas, or Moros). Therefore, a clear and definitive conclusion cannot be drawn from the text alone.
