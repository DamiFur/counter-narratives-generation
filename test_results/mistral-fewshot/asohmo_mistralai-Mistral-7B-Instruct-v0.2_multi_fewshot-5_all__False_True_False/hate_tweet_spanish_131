| Property associatedwith the collective:violaciones| Justificación:en mierditerráneodigitalandanunpocobesionadosconlasviolacioneslasficticias(fact)| Conclusion:denunciarqueungcunmilitarviaronacríade18añosnoquedamuypatriotagaysyunmarroquí¿serángaysnegrosudacasormoros?(fact)There seems to be a misunderstanding here. Let me clarify:The hate speech in this tweet is directed towards gays and Marroquíes (people from Morocco), and the property associated with them is the accusation of fictitious violations. The justification for this hate speech is that there are people in Mierditteráneo Digital who are "a little obsessed with violations" and have made false accusations of a GC (group chat) and a military member violating an 18-year-old girl. The conclusion drawn from this false accusation is that gays and Moroccans may be gay, negro (black), and sudacas (Sudanese) or moros (Moroccans).It's important to note that these accusations are baseless
