| Justification: in Mierditerráneo digital they are a bit obsessed with fictitious violations, denouncing that a GC and a soldier violated a 18-year-old girl, it is not very patriotic for gays and a Marroquí, ¿will they be gay black Sudacas or Moros? (fact)| Conclusion: |There seems to be a lack of clear conclusion in the provided text. The text mentions that there is an obsession with fictional violations on Mierditteráneo digital, and that a denunciation of a violation involving a GC, a soldier, and an 18 year old girl, is not considered patriotic towards gays and someone from Morocco. However, it does not provide a clear conclusion as to what the connection is between being gay, black, Sudacan, or Moroccan, and this supposed obsession or lack of patriotism. It would be helpful to have more context or information to draw a definitive conclusion.
