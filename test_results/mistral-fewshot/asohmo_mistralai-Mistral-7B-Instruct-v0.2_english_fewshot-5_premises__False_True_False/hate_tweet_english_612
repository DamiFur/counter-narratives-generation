@user @user @user @user a very high wall must be build to protect usa from bad elements of illigal refugees
1. Building a wall may not be the most effective solution, as there are other ways for people to enter a country illegally, such as through air travel or overstaying visas.2. The cost of building and maintaining a wall could be better spent on addressing the root causes of migration, such as poverty, violence, and instability in the countries people are leaving.3. A wall could also have negative economic and social consequences, such as damaging relationships with neighboring countries and making it more difficult for legal trade and travel.4. There are also ethical considerations to take into account, such as the human rights of migrants and refugees, and the potential for discrimination and xenophobia.5. It's important to remember that the vast majority of immigrants, including undocumented ones, are law-abiding and contribute positively to society.Therefore, instead of building a wall, it would be more productive to focus on finding comprehensive and humane solutions to address the issue of illegal immigration.
