"Unbelievable" that there are people who don't speak English as their first language in certain areas, so we should stop immigration? That's not a solution to the problem. It's important to remember that every person has the right to live and work in a place where they can thrive, regardless of their language abilities. Providing additional resources to help students learn English and succeed in school is a more productive approach.
