"Muslims" is a religious group, not a nationality. Building a wall to keep out a specific religious group goes against the principles of equality and freedom of religion.Furthermore, it's important to remember that the vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and law-abiding citizens. It's not fair to stereotype an entire group based on the actions of a few.Instead, we should focus on addressing the root causes of why people are leaving their countries and coming to the US, such as poverty, violence, and lack of opportunities. By working together to find solutions to these issues, we can create a more peaceful and prosperous world for everyone.Building a wall will not solve the problem, it will only create more division and mistrust. Let's focus on building bridges, not walls.
