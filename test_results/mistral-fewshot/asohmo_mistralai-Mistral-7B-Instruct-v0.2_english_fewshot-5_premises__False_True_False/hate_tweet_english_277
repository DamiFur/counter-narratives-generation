1. It's important to note that not all immigrants use public assistance, and many contribute more to the economy than they take.2. There are ways to address the strain on public assistance programs without denying entry to those who don't pose a threat to national security or public safety.3. Denying entry to immigrants based on their potential use of public assistance is not a fair or effective solution to the issue.4. A more comprehensive approach, such as reforming and strengthening public assistance programs, addressing the root causes of poverty and inequality, and finding ways to integrate immigrants into the workforce, would be more beneficial for both immigrants and American society as a whole.
