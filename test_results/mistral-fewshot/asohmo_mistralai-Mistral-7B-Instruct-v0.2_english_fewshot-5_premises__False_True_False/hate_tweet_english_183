"Hard working Americans" are not a monolithic group, and not all of them hold the same views on immigration policy. It's important to recognize that there are diverse perspectives within the American population.Furthermore, building a wall and eliminating chain migration, visa lottery, and amnesty are not the only solutions to address the complex issue of immigration. A comprehensive approach that considers the economic, social, and humanitarian aspects of immigration is necessary.Lastly, it's essential to remember that using derogatory labels like "corrupt democrats" and "lies" does not contribute to a productive and respectful conversation on this topic. Let's focus on finding common ground and working towards a solution that benefits everyone.
