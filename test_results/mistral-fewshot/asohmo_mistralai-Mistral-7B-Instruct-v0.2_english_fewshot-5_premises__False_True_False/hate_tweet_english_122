@user hello?? stop groping my nation schneider: current migrant crisis " represents a plan orchestrated and prepared for a long time by international powers to radically alter christian and national identity of european peoples " http
1. It's not clear what you mean by "groping" in this context.2. Even if the migrant crisis was orchestrated by international powers, it doesn't justify treating all migrants as a threat.3. European identity is diverse and includes many religions and nationalities, not just Christian.4. Policies should be based on facts and compassion, not fear and xenophobia.
