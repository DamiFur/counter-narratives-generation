@user and this is exactly how it should be in england crime is low in slovakia etc but all the scumbags come to to commit crimes as they know they can get away with it - they never return hashtag stop immigration
"Scumbags" are a small minority. It's not fair to judge an entire group based on the actions of a few.Instead, let's focus on addressing the root causes of crime and ensuring that those who do commit crimes are held accountable, regardless of their nationality.Additionally, it's important to remember that immigrants contribute positively to society in many ways, including economically, culturally, and socially.Let's work towards a more inclusive and compassionate society. #welcomerefugees #diversityisourstrength
