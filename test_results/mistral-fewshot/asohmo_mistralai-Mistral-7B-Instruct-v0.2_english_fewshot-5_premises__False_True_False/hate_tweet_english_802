@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
1. Not all economic migrants pose as refugees, and not all refugees are economic migrants.2. Many refugees don't have the means or the safety to travel to Europe through Turkey.3. The distinction between economic migrants and refugees is not always clear-cut, and it's not up to us to decide who is who.4. The idea that all migrants come to Europe for welfare benefits is a stereotype and an oversimplification of a complex issue.5. It's important to remember that everyone has the right to seek asylum and protection from persecution, regardless of their reasons for leaving their home country.
