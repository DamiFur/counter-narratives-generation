1. Fact: Losing identity and jobs to illegal aliens is a concern for some people.2. Policy: Building a wall and stopping illegals is a proposed solution.However, it's important to remember that:1. Not all illegal immigrants take jobs away from Americans. Many do jobs that Americans don't want to do.2. Building a wall won't stop all illegal immigration, and it won't bring back jobs that have been outsourced or lost to automation.3. The term "illegal aliens" can be seen as dehumanizing and disrespectful. It's more accurate and respectful to use terms like "undocumented immigrants" or "unauthorized immigrants."4. The economic and social costs of building a wall and deporting millions of people would be enormous.5. There are more effective and humane ways to address the issue of illegal immigration, such as comprehensive immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.
