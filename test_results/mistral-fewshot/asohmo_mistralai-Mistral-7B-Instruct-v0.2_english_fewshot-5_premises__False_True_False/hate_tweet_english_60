@user for god sake dont put india to danger by unchecked appeasement of ur special community illegal migrants nation is supreme
"For God's sake, don't put India at risk by unchecked favoritism towards a specific community of illegal migrants. The nation comes first."It's important to remember that every individual, regardless of their background, should be treated with dignity and respect, while also upholding the rule of law and ensuring the safety and security of the nation. It's not about favoritism or appeasement, but about fairness and justice for all.
