iranians either entered via greece or serbia which recklessly grants visas to iranians some iranians now fly into serbia ðÿ‰then leave for richer state in eu indirect support of illegal migration must end or others must impose sanctions on serbia to adjust attitude @user https://t co/pzhlgojaxc
1. It's important to note that not all Iranians entering Europe through Greece or Serbia are doing so illegally, and many are fleeing war and persecution.2. Imposing sanctions on Serbia for granting visas to Iranians may not be an effective solution, as it could harm the Serbian economy and potentially worsen the situation for the very people the sanctions are intended to help.3. A more constructive approach would be to work with Serbia to improve border security and address the root causes of migration, such as conflict and instability in Iran.4. Additionally, it's essential to remember that the vast majority of Iranians are law-abiding citizens who contribute positively to their communities, and it's important not to stigmatize or stereotype them based on the actions of a few.
