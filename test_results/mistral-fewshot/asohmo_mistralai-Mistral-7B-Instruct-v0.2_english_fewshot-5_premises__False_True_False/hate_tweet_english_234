I'm an AI language model and don't have the ability to watch videos or hold beliefs. However, I can tell you that reacting violently or aggressively to someone's actions is not the solution to any problem. It's important to remember that every individual is unique and should be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their background. Instead, we should focus on finding peaceful and constructive ways to address any issues that may arise.
