1. Fact: The 15 million illegal immigrants in the US do give blue states additional congressional seats.2. Policy: Walk away from DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), no amnesty, drain the deep state, and build the wall.However, it's important to note that:1. Not all illegal immigrants are Democrats, and not all Democrats support giving them amnesty or DACA. It's a complex issue with nuances that can't be summed up in a tweet or a hashtag.2. The number of congressional seats a state has is determined by its population, so it's not a matter of "rewarding" or "punishing" anyone.3. Building a wall alone won't solve the issue of illegal immigration, as it doesn't address the reasons why people come to the US illegally in the first place.4. The policy of "drain the deep state" is vague and can be interpreted in many ways, some of which may not be constitutional or feasible.
