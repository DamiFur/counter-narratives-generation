today in tallin: puppets of the financial establishment dream from a new europe with many slaves macron a wordmouth and kern a refugeelover https://t co/yfkd6dsjfm
"Macron is a mouthpiece for the financial establishment" and "Kern is a lover of refugees" are two separate statements. It's important not to mix them up.Regarding the first statement, it's important to remember that being a representative of a financial establishment doesn't automatically make someone a bad person or a "puppet." It's possible for someone to hold a position in the financial sector and still have the best interests of their country and its people at heart.As for the second statement, being a "refugeelover" is not a negative term. Many people believe that welcoming refugees is a humanitarian act and an important part of upholding the values of compassion and empathy.It's also important to consider the source of the information being presented. Is it coming from a reputable and trustworthy source, or is it coming from someone with a biased or agenda-driven perspective? It's always a good idea to fact-check information and consider multiple perspectives before forming an opinion.
