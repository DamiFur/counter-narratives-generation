"Clean" is a subjective term. Refusing entry to refugees doesn't make a country clean, it makes it exclusionary.Japan's approach may work for them, but it's not a solution that can be universally applied. Every country has its own unique circumstances and challenges when it comes to immigration and refugee policy.It's important to remember that every human being has the right to seek asylum and protection from persecution, regardless of where they come from. The international community has a responsibility to ensure that this right is upheld, and that refugees are treated with dignity and respect.Instead of focusing on keeping countries "clean" from refugees, we should be working towards creating a more inclusive and welcoming world, where everyone has the opportunity to live in safety and security, regardless of their nationality or background.
