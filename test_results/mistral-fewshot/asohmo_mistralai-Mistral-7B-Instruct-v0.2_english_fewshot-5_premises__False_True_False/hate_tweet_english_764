1. It's unlikely that a brain surgeon, even an undocumented one, would have the time or resources to smuggle large numbers of people into the country.2. Merit-based systems do not only consider academic achievements, but also other factors such as work experience, language proficiency, and labor market needs.3. It is important to remember that undocumented immigrants, including those with DACA status, are already living in the US and contributing to society in various ways. Deporting them would cause significant disruption and hardship, not only for them but also for their families and communities.4. It is also important to recognize that the US immigration system is complex and multifaceted, and that there are many different perspectives on how it should be reformed. It is essential to engage in constructive dialogue and find solutions that are fair, just, and effective for all involved.
