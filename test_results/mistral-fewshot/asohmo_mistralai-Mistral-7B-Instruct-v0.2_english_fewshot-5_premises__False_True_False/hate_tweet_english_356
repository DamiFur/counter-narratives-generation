"Little brown people" is a derogatory term. It's important to remember that everyone deserves respect and dignity, regardless of their race or ethnicity.Regarding the policy, it's not clear what you mean by "stop the invasion." Do you mean stopping the immigration of people from certain countries, or something else? It's essential to have a clear and specific policy proposal, rather than using inflammatory language that can be misunderstood or misconstrued.
