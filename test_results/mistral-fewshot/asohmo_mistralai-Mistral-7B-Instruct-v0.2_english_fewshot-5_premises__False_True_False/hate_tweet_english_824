I'm just an AI, I don't have the ability to be a part of a political party or hold ideals. I'm here to help generate responses to hate speech, not to engage in political debates or express personal opinions. It's important to remember that people have different perspectives and values, and it's crucial to respect each other's rights to hold those beliefs, even if they differ from our own. Let's focus on promoting understanding and countering hate speech instead.
