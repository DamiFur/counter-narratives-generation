"Mass migration" and "terrorist cells" are not mutually exclusive. A US war with Iran could potentially lead to an increase in refugees and instability in the region, which could in turn lead to more terrorism. However, it's important to note that correlation does not imply causation, and the situation is complex and multifaceted. As for Bolton being a "neocon nightmare" and a "discredited failure," that is an opinion and not a fact.
