1. It's important to remember that not all undocumented immigrants are criminals or a drain on resources.2. Deporting all criminals, regardless of their immigration status, is a costly and complex process.3. The policy of "no amnesty" doesn't address the issue of what to do with those who have been deported and try to re-enter the country.4. Building a wall and ending sanctuary cities, chain migration, and the Diversity Visa Lottery may not be effective solutions to the issue of illegal immigration.5. Mandatory E-Verify may help prevent future illegal immigration, but it does not address the current issue of those already in the country without proper documentation.Instead of focusing solely on punishment and deportation, it may be more effective to address the root causes of illegal immigration, such as poverty, violence, and lack of opportunity in the countries of origin, as well as improving the legal immigration process and providing a pathway to citizenship for those who are already here and contributing to society.
