@user must deport all illegal migrants india already reeling under constant threat of muslim radicals curb population
1. Fact: India is facing a threat from Muslim radicals.2. Conclusion: All illegal migrants, regardless of their religious background, should be deported.This conclusion does not logically follow from the fact presented. It's important to remember that not all illegal immigrants are Muslim radicals, and targeting a specific group based on religion is not a fair or effective solution to the issue at hand. Instead, efforts should be made to address the root causes of the threat and find ways to ensure the safety and security of all communities in India.
