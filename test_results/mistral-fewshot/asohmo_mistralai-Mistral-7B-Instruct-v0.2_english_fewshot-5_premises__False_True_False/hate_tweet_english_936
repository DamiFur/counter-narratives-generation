"The Hillary email scandal and the unmasking of US citizens by the FBI, CIA, and DOJ is indeed a significant issue, but it's important to remember that it's not the only scandal in US politics. While it's true that there were allegations of perjury and obstruction, it's also important to consider the context and evidence surrounding these allegations. The term 'silent coup' is often used to describe a perceived attempt to remove a sitting president from power without due process or legal justification. Whether or not that characterization is accurate is a matter of debate. Ultimately, the investigation into these matters is ongoing, and it's crucial that we continue to seek the truth and hold those responsible accountable, regardless of political affiliation." #transparency #accountability #ruleoflaw #factsmatter #usapolitics #democracy #truthseekers #stayinformed #stayengaged #maga #kag #trump #potus #news #usa #walkaway #draintheswamp #nodaca
