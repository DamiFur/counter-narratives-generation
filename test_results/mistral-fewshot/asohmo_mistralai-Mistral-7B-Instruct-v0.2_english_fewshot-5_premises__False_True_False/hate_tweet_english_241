americans agree with @user on hashtag immigration we can not afford to give welfare to illegals while u s citizens are homeless hashtag votedemsout hashtag familiesbelongtogethermarch https://t co/f3dteejp34
1. It's important to remember that not all undocumented immigrants receive welfare, and many contribute to the economy through taxes and labor.2. The statement "families belong together march" contradicts the statement "votedemsout", as the Democratic Party supports policies that keep families together.3. The link provided does not support the claim that "Americans agree" with @user's stance on immigration. It only shows that some Americans attended a rally with that message.
