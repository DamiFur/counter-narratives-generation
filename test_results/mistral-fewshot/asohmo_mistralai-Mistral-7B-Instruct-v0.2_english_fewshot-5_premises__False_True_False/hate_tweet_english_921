"Jihadists" is a term used to describe individuals who engage in violent acts in the name of Islam. It is important to remember that the vast majority of Muslims around the world reject violence and extremism. Sending people back based on their religion or ethnicity is not a solution to the problem of terrorism. Instead, we should focus on addressing the root causes of extremism and working together to build peaceful and inclusive societies.
