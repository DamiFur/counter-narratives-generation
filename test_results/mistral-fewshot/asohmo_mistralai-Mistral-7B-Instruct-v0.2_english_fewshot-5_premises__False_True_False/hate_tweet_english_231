"Stringing up" someone is a violent act, and it's not a solution to the problem of illegal immigration. Building a wall and enforcing immigration laws is a more effective and humane approach.Additionally, it's important to remember that the vast majority of undocumented immigrants are not violent criminals, but rather hardworking individuals who came to the US in search of a better life for themselves and their families.It's also important to note that the US has a long history of accepting and integrating immigrants from all over the world, and that the current immigration system is broken and needs to be reformed in a way that is fair and just for all parties involved.Therefore, instead of resorting to violence and hate speech, we should focus on finding a comprehensive and humane solution to the issue of illegal immigration, one that respects the dignity and human rights of all individuals involved.
