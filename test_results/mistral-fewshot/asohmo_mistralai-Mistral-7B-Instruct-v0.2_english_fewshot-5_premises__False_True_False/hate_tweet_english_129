1. It's important to remember that not all illegal immigrants or refugees bring crime. In fact, studies have shown that they have lower crime rates than native-born citizens.2. Sending people back to their home countries is not a solution for everyone. There are complex reasons why people leave their home countries, and simply sending them back without addressing the root causes of their displacement will not solve the problem.3. The term "refugees invaders" is inflammatory and inaccurate. Refugees are people who have been forced to leave their homes due to war, persecution, or other forms of violence. They are not invaders.4. The DACA program, which allows certain undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children to remain in the country without fear of deportation, is not a reward. It is a recognition of the fact that these individuals have grown up in the US and have contributed to their communities.5. It is important to consider the human rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status. We should strive to find solutions that are compassionate, just, and effective in addressing the complex issue of immigration.
