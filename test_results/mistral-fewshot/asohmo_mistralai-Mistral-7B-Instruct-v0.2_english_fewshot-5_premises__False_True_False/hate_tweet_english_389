"Sanctuary cities" are not against the law. They are cities that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. Arresting and prosecuting mayors and governors for this would be a violation of their constitutional rights.Furthermore, it's important to remember that the vast majority of undocumented immigrants are law-abiding citizens who contribute positively to society. Criminalizing an entire group based on their immigration status is not a solution to the complex issue of illegal immigration.Instead, we should focus on comprehensive immigration reform that addresses the root causes of illegal immigration and provides a pathway to legal status for those who are already here. This approach is in line with American values of fairness, justice, and opportunity for all.
