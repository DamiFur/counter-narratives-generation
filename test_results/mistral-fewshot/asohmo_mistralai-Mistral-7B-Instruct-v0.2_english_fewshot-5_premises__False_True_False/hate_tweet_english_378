"Tough days" and "not tolerating" illegal immigrants does not necessarily mean sending them back to their country of origin. There could be other ways to address the issue.Additionally, it's important to ensure that any actions taken are in line with international law and human rights standards. Sending people back to a country where they may face persecution or harm is not an acceptable solution.Furthermore, it is important to remember that every individual is unique and should be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status. It's crucial to approach this issue with empathy and understanding, rather than fear and hostility.Instead of focusing on sending people back, efforts could be made to address the root causes of why people are leaving their home countries and coming to Bengal in the first place, such as poverty, violence, and lack of opportunities. By addressing these underlying issues, it may be possible to find long-term solutions that benefit both the sending and receiving countries.Lastly, it is essential to engage in open and respectful dialogue with all stakeholders, including immigrants, community leaders, and government officials, to find a fair and just solution that respects the human rights and dignity of all involved.
