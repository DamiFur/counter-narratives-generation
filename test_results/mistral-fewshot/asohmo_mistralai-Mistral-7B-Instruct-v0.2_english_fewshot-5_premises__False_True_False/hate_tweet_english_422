1. It's important to remember that not all immigrants are illegal, and not all illegal immigrants are from Latin America.2. The economic impact of immigration, both legal and illegal, is a complex issue and depends on various factors, including the specific labor market conditions and the skills and qualifications of the immigrants.3. It is also important to consider the potential benefits of immigration, such as the contribution of immigrants to the economy through their labor and entrepreneurship, as well as the cultural and social enrichment that comes from a diverse population.4. Additionally, it is important to address the root causes of why people are leaving their home countries and coming to the US illegally, such as poverty, violence, and lack of opportunities, rather than just focusing on the symptoms.5. Lastly, it is crucial to have a comprehensive and humane immigration policy that balances the needs of the economy, security, and human rights.Therefore, while it is true that some groups, including Hispanics and African Americans, may be impacted by illegal immigration, it is not accurate to say that they are the only ones affected or that the impact is solely negative. A more nuanced and balanced approach is needed to address this complex issue.
