"@user if the refugees dont get food and water - they will go back quick here the president havnt to do much "

Denying them food and water is not a solution, it's a violation of human rights.Instead, let's focus on providing them with the help they need and ensuring their safe and orderly return to their countries of origin.#Compassion #HumanRights #RefugeesWelcome #BuildBridgesNotWalls
