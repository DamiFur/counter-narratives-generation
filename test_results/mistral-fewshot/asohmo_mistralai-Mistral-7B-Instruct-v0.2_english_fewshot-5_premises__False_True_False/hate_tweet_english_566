1. Using the military to build a wall goes against the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which forbids the use of the military for law enforcement within the United States without the consent of Congress.2. Building a wall with the military would be an excessive use of force and a violation of civil liberties.3. The military has better things to do than build a wall.4. The wall would not solve the root causes of immigration and would be a costly and ineffective solution.5. The military is not a construction crew and does not have the resources or expertise to build a border wall effectively.6. The use of military personnel for non-military purposes would divert resources and attention away from their primary mission of protecting the country.7. The wall goes against American values of welcoming immigrants and upholding the rule of law.8. The wall is a symbol of division and xenophobia, rather than a solution to the complex issue of immigration.9. Building the wall would be a waste of taxpayer money that could be better spent on education, healthcare, infrastructure, and other pressing issues.10. The wall violates international law and could lead to diplomatic tensions with neighboring countries.
