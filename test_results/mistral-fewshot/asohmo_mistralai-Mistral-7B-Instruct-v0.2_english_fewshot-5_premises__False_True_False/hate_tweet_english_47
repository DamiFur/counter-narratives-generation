immigration gone crazy 100 trainee doctors from abroad what about nurse practitioners who are their equivalent get pain peanuts and are trained and come from the uk
"Immigration gone crazy" is an opinion, not a fact. It's important to differentiate between facts and opinions.The fact is that there is a difference in salary between trainee doctors and nurse practitioners, and some nurse practitioners come from the UK.It's understandable to have concerns about fairness in the labor market, but it's essential to approach these issues with accurate information and nuanced perspectives.Instead of labeling it as "immigration gone crazy," we could focus on the root causes of the issue, such as wage disparities and labor market policies, and work towards finding solutions that benefit everyone involved.Additionally, it's worth noting that there are many nurse practitioners from the US who also face similar wage disparities, and addressing this issue would benefit them as well.Therefore, a more constructive response could be:"It's concerning that there's a significant wage disparity between nurse practitioners and trainee doctors, regardless of their country of origin. We need to address this issue to ensure fair compensation for all healthcare professionals."
