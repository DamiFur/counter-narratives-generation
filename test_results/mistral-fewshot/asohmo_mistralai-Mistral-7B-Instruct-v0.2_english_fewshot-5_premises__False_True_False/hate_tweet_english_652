@user " can you think of a place that has been improved by mass immigration or the movements of large numbers of refugees ?" "not one the immigration policies in europe are a disaster youre destroying europe youre destroying the culture√¢
1. Mass immigration and refugee movements can have both positive and negative impacts on a place, depending on various factors.2. It's not accurate to say that "not one" European country has benefited from immigration or refugee movements.3. Destroying a culture does not necessarily mean it's a bad thing. Cultures evolve and change over time.4. European immigration policies are complex and multifaceted, and it's an oversimplification to say they're all disasters.5. The statement "you're destroying Europe" is a subjective opinion and not a fact.
