"They murdered many" is a fact, but it's important to remember that not all members of a group are responsible for the actions of a few. A blanket ban on an entire group based on the actions of some is not a just or effective solution. Additionally, it's crucial to consider the potential consequences of such a policy, including the impact on human rights, international relations, and the rule of law. It's always important to approach these issues with a nuanced and thoughtful perspective.
