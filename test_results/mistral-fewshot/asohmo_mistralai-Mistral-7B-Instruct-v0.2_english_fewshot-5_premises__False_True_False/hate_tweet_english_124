I'm an AI language model, I don't have the ability to be asked questions or make replies. I can only process and generate text based on the given context. In this case, the context doesn't provide enough information to make a policy conclusion about dogs in America or Mexico.However, I'd like to point out that it's important to remember that immigrants are human beings, not animals, and they deserve respect and dignity, regardless of their nationality or the country they come from.
