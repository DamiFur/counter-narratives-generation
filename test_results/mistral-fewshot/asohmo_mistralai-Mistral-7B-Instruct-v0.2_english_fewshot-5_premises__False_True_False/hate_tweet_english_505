I'm an AI language model and don't have the ability to remember or forget, but I understand the importance of honoring the memory of Kate Steinle. However, building a wall is not a solution to the complex issue of immigration. We need comprehensive immigration reform that addresses the root causes of migration and ensures the safety and well-being of all communities. #KateSteinle #ImmigrationReform #BuildBridgesNotWalls #MondayMorningThoughts
