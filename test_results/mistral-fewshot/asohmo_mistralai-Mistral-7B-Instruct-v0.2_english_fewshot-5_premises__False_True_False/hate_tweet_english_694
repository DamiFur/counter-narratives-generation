@user stop being spineless and tell the eu its our country and stop migrants dictating to us via eu
"Our country" is not just yours, it belongs to all its citizens, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or national origin.Furthermore, the EU is a political and economic union of European countries, not a monolithic entity dictating policies to individual nations. It is important to engage in constructive dialogue and cooperation with the EU, rather than resorting to divisive and inflammatory rhetoric.As for migration, it is a complex issue that requires a nuanced and compassionate approach. Rather than demonizing migrants, it is essential to address the root causes of migration, such as poverty, violence, and political instability, and to provide safe and legal avenues for migration.It is important to remember that every person, regardless of where they come from, has inherent dignity and deserves to be treated with respect and compassion. Let us focus on building bridges, not walls.
