"""@user @user @user it may have to do with plain honest speech so many politicians have the """political speech""" bug theyre accustomed to stating what people want to hear & not what they need to like saying it is hashtag fucktarded to believe the mass hashtag refugee / hashtag rapefugee immigration was good is idiodic"" "
"Political correctness" can be a double-edged sword. While it's important to be truthful, it's also important to avoid stigmatizing entire groups based on stereotypes. The term "rapefugee" is offensive and inaccurate.Moreover, the benefits of refugee resettlement have been well-documented, both for the refugees themselves and for the host communities. The economic, social, and cultural contributions of refugees have been shown to outweigh the costs.It's also worth noting that the vast majority of refugees are women and children, and they are fleeing from violence and persecution, not seeking to commit crimes. The idea that refugees are a threat to public safety is a myth perpetuated by fear-mongering and misinformation.Therefore, it is indeed idiotic to believe that mass refugee immigration was bad without considering the facts and evidence.
