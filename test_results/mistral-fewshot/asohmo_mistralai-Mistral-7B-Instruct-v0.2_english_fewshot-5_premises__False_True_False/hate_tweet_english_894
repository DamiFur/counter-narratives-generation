"@user @user the usa is not supposed to make the world a better place it is supposed to make our liberty and earnings safe from politicians and we are not supposed to play world cop either nor are we a rapefugee hostel dumping ground for toxic cultures illegals and the death cult "
"Toxic cultures" and "death cult" are derogatory terms. It's important to remember that all people, regardless of their background, deserve respect and dignity.Furthermore, it's not accurate to say that all immigrants bring toxic cultures or are part of a death cult. The vast majority of immigrants contribute positively to their new communities.It's also worth noting that many immigrants come to the US seeking safety and a better life for themselves and their families. They are not "illegals" or "rapefugees," but rather human beings with hopes, dreams, and the same fundamental rights as everyone else.Lastly, the US has a long history of welcoming immigrants and has always been a beacon of hope and opportunity for people from all over the world. It is not a "rape refuge hostel" or a "dumping ground" for anyone.
