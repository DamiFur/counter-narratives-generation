1. Not all illegal immigrants are from third-world countries.2. Deporting people and separating families is not a humane solution.3. Many illegal immigrants contribute to the economy and pay taxes.4. The US has a long history of accepting immigrants and should continue to do so in a fair and just manner.5. Building a wall will not solve the issue of illegal immigration, as people will find other ways to enter the country.6. DACA recipients, who were brought to the US as children and have grown up here, should be given a chance to stay and contribute to society.7. The US should focus on comprehensive immigration reform that addresses the root causes of illegal immigration and provides a pathway to legal status for those who are already here.
