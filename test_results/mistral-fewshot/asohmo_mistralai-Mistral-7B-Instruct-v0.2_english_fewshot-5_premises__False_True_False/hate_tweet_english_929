@user @user string him up to show the message that you will pay for your crimes in a country where you are not supposed to be in hashtag buildthatwall we are losing our legal citizens to those who should not be here in the first place if they werent here we would still have our loved ones
"Stringing up" someone is a violent act, and it's not a solution to the problem. Let's focus on finding peaceful and just solutions instead.Regarding the fact, it's important to remember that the vast majority of undocumented immigrants are law-abiding citizens who contribute positively to society. It's also important to address the root causes of why people are forced to leave their countries and come to the US illegally, such as poverty, violence, and lack of opportunities.Instead of focusing on punishing individuals, let's work on creating a fair and just immigration system that respects human rights and provides a pathway to legal status for those who want to contribute to our society.
