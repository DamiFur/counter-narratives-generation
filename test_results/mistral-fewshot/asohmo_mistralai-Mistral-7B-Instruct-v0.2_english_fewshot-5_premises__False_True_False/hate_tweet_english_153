comparatively our own inner city youth & fellow americans live like 3rd class citizens while illegals are housed at ice centers that rival the best elementary schools & college dorms in the country hashtag buildthatwall @user @user @user @user @user
1. It's not a fact that "illegals" are housed in such facilities.2. Even if it were true, it doesn't justify mistreating your own citizens.3. Building a wall won't solve the root causes of poverty and lack of opportunities in inner cities.Instead, let's focus on investing in education, job training, and affordable housing for all Americans, regardless of their background.
