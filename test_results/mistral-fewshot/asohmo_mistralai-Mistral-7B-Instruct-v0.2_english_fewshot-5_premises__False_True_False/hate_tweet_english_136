I'm an AI language model, I don't have the ability to bet or observe people's reactions in real life. However, I can tell you that this might not be an effective solution, as it doesn't address the root cause of the issue and may not change people's opinions.Additionally, it's important to note that not all illegal immigrants are a burden on the American taxpayer, many contribute to the economy and pay taxes themselves. It's a complex issue that requires a nuanced approach.
