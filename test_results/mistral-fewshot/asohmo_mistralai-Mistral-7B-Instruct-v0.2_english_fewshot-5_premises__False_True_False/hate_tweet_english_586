1. It's not a fact that all refugees are drunken or that they are more likely to be drunk than the general population.2. Leaving one's country to seek a better life is a human right, not a dream.3. The risks of the journey should not be used as an argument against seeking asylum or a better life.4. The decision to leave or stay should be based on individual circumstances, not generalizations.
