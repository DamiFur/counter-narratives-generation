hungary referendum: 98% of voters reject islamic immigration - muslims are offended - free speech time - https://t co/dlnslapka7 @user
1. It's not a fact that Muslims are offended by the referendum as a whole, only some may be.2. Freedom of speech does not mean freedom from criticism or offense.3. The referendum does not directly affect Muslims in Hungary, as they are already a small minority there.4. It is important to remember that not all Muslims support or condone violent extremism, and it is crucial to differentiate between the actions of a small extremist minority and the beliefs and actions of the vast majority of peaceful, law-abiding Muslims.5. The focus should be on promoting understanding, tolerance, and peaceful coexistence between different religious and ethnic groups, rather than stoking fear and division.
