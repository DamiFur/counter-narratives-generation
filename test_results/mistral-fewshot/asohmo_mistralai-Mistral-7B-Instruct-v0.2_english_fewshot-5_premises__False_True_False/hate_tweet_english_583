1. It's not a fact that there is a racial replacement or genocide happening in France.2. The number of French players in the World Cup team does not change the fact that the statement "does he realize he's cheering for..." is a false and inflammatory accusation.3. The use of hashtags like "whitepride," "white lives matter," and "securetheborder" is a clear indication of racism and xenophobia.4. It is important to promote understanding, respect, and unity among all people, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or nationality.5. Let's focus on the positive aspects of the World Cup and use it as an opportunity to bring people together, rather than fueling hate and division.
