1. It's important to note that the Pope's decision to not open St. Peter's Basilica to refugees does not necessarily reflect the views of all Catholic bishops, black or otherwise.2. The Pope's actions may be influenced by a variety of factors, including logistical and practical considerations.3. The statement "they don't want to lose their sheep" can be interpreted in different ways. It could mean that the bishops fear losing their followers if they publicly criticize the Pope, or it could mean that they believe their flock would be better served by staying in their home countries rather than coming to Europe as refugees.4. Regardless of the motivations behind the bishop's stance, it is important to remember that complex issues like immigration and refugee policy require nuanced and compassionate solutions that take into account the needs and rights of all parties involved. It is not helpful to oversimplify the situation or to make assumptions about the motivations of individuals or groups based on limited information.5. It is also worth noting that there are many ways for individuals and organizations to make a positive impact on the lives of refugees and migrants, such as volunteering, donating resources, and advocating for policies that support their integration and well-being.
