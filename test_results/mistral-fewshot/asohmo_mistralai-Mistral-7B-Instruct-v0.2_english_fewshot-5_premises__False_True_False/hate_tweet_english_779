Both ICE and MS-13 are groups of people, but one is a law enforcement agency and the other is a criminal organization. Comparing them is not fair or accurate.Furthermore, just because someone didn't say something in the past doesn't mean they can't change their opinion or that their current opinion is wrong.It's important to remember that language matters and can be used to incite fear and hatred, or to bring people together. Let's focus on promoting understanding and respect for all people, regardless of their background or immigration status.
