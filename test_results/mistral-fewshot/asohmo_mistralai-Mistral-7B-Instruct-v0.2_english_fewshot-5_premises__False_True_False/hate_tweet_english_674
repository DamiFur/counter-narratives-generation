"Unchecked population and migration to cities" is a complex issue with many causes and consequences. "Disincentivizing large families" is just one possible solution, but it might not be the most effective or fair one.It's important to consider the root causes of population growth and urbanization, such as poverty, lack of access to education and healthcare, and economic opportunities. Addressing these underlying issues could help reduce population growth and improve living conditions in urban areas.Moreover, "disincentives" such as withdrawing subsidies could disproportionately affect the most vulnerable populations, who may already be struggling to make ends meet. It's crucial to consider the potential unintended consequences of such policies and explore alternative solutions that are more equitable and effective.Lastly, it's essential to remember that every individual and family has the right to plan their own lives and have as many children as they choose, as long as they are able to provide for them. Population control measures should be approached with sensitivity and respect for human rights.
