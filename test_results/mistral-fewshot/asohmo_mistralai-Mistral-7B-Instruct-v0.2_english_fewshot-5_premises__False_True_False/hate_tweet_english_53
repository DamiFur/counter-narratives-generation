@user migrant s get here then they phone for the next load to come mobile phones cost not such a thing as a poor migrant with a phon
1. Not all migrants have access to mobile phones.2. Even if they do, it doesn't mean they're calling for more to come.3. The cost of a phone doesn't determine their financial situation.4. It's important to remember that not all migrants are the same, and making assumptions based on stereotypes is harmful and inaccurate.
