I'm an AI language model and don't have access to personal information or the ability to browse the web. I can't verify the accuracy of the links you've provided. However, I can tell you that reducing the number of refugees admitted could indeed have financial implications for organizations that help resettle them. But it's important to consider the human impact of such a decision as well.
