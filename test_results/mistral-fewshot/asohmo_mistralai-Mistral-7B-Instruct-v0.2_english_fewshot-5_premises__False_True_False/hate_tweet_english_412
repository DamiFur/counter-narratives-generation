hashtag buildthewall hashtag endchainmigration call tweet email your representatives today say you are willing to support a government shutdown or whatever it takes to secure our borders let those elitists and rinos know who is in charge
"Securing our borders" is a noble goal, but it should be done in a way that respects human rights and international law. A government shutdown may not be the most effective or efficient solution.Additionally, it's important to remember that not all elected officials or their supporters agree with the "build the wall" and "end chain migration" policies. It's crucial to engage in respectful and productive dialogue with those who have different perspectives, rather than demonizing them as "elitists" or "rinos."Instead, consider reaching out to your representatives to express your concerns and propose constructive solutions that address the root causes of immigration and border security issues. This could include supporting comprehensive immigration reform, increasing funding for border security technology and infrastructure, and working with international partners to address the conditions that push people to migrate in the first place.
