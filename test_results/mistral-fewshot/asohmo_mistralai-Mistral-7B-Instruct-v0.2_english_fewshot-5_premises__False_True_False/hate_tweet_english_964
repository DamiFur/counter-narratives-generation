"illegals" are human beings. They deserve respect and dignity, regardless of their legal status.It's important to remember that there are complex reasons why people migrate, and punishing children for their parents' actions is not a solution.Instead, let's focus on finding long-term, humane solutions to address the root causes of migration and provide a pathway to legal status for those who are already here.#compassion #humanity #solutionsnotpunishment
