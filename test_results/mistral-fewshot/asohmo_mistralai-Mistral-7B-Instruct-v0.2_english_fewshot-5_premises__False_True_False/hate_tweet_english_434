@user who care for these children of criminal refugees really they play no role in times of overpopulation
"They play no role" does not imply "they don't deserve care" or "they are not valuable members of society."It's important to remember that everyone deserves basic human rights and dignity, regardless of their background or circumstances. Overpopulation is a complex issue that requires comprehensive solutions, not the abandonment of vulnerable individuals.
