@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
1. It's important to note that asylum seekers and illegal immigrants are not the same thing.2. There are complex reasons why some people may not be able to apply for asylum within a year, such as fear of persecution or lack of access to information about the process.3. The U.S. immigration system is complex and can be difficult to navigate, especially for those who do not have the means or resources to do so.4. Deporting people who have been living in the country for years and have built a life there can have negative consequences for both the individuals and their communities.5. A more compassionate and effective approach would be to provide resources and support to help people navigate the asylum process and ensure that they are able to do so in a timely and efficient manner.6. Ultimately, the goal should be to create a fair and just immigration system that respects the human rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.
