so the economic migration crisis will now get rapidly worse into 2021 and anyone opining that a province like ontario can absorb a million people into the social infrastructure is not understanding the macro events underway and the system collapse that would trigger
1. It's important to note that correlation does not imply causation. The economic migration crisis and the ability of a province like Ontario to absorb a large number of people are two separate issues.2. While it's true that there might be economic challenges due to mass migration, it's also important to consider the potential economic benefits, such as increased labor force, tax revenue, and innovation.3. Additionally, there are various ways to mitigate the potential negative impacts of mass migration, such as investing in infrastructure, providing adequate social services, and implementing effective integration programs.4. The idea of a "system collapse" is an exaggeration and not based on factual evidence.5. Ultimately, the impact of mass migration on a province's economy depends on various factors, including the availability of resources, the effectiveness of government policies, and the willingness of the local population to welcome and integrate newcomers.
