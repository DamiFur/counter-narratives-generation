1. The number of illegal immigrants and their voting patterns do not justify the conclusion that there should be no DACA or any other immigration policy.2. The statement "illegals est entre 11-30 million" is an approximation, and the exact number is not known.3. The fact that some illegal immigrants may have voted for Democrats does not mean that all Democrats support illegal immigration or that they want open borders.4. Voter ID laws do not prevent illegal immigrants from voting, as they do not have the right to vote in the first place.5. The Democratic Party's stance on immigration policy is complex and multifaceted, and it is not accurate to reduce it to "no walls, no borders, no voter IDs."
