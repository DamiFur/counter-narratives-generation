@user theres an agenda jprdan: white genocide is a crime eu funded report tells journalists not to write negative articles on migrant crisis "it even urges them to report colleagues to the authorities for hate speech crimes "https://t
"White genocide" is not a recognized term in international law. It's a term used by white supremacists to describe the supposed extinction of the white race. The EU report you're referring to is aimed at combating hate speech, which includes speech that incites violence or discrimination based on race, religion, or other factors. It is not an attempt to suppress criticism of migration or to promote "white genocide."Additionally, it's important to note that there is no credible evidence to support the claim that "thousands of Americans" are being killed by "illegal aliens." According to the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security, undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans.It's also worth mentioning that the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program, which you mentioned earlier, does not grant amnesty or a path to citizenship. It only provides temporary relief from deportation and the ability to work legally in the United States. It does not give "rewards" to illegal immigrants.
