"Illegals" are not a monolithic group. Some contribute positively to the economy, while others do not. The judge's statement only refers to those who work and pay taxes. The overall impact of illegal immigration on the US economy is a complex issue and depends on various factors.Moreover, even if "illegals" as a whole do not contribute significantly to the US economy, it does not justify denying them basic human rights and dignity. They are still human beings and deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their legal status.It's important to remember that every individual is unique and should be treated as such, rather than being reduced to a label or a statistic.
