"Entire India is with you" does not mean that every Indian citizen agrees with your policy. It's important to remember that there are diverse opinions and perspectives within any population.Furthermore, it's crucial to consider the potential consequences of such a policy, including the impact on human rights, international relations, and social cohesion.It's essential to approach this issue with empathy, compassion, and a commitment to upholding the rule of law. Let's focus on finding long-term, sustainable solutions that address the root causes of migration and promote peace and stability in the region.
