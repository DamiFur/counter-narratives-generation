regardless of intent the term " undocumented immigrant " is incorrect because illegal aliens are foreigners (i e aliens ) who are unlawfully present in the united states (i e illegal) https://t co/aarjtduwya https://t co/hkrv7mpzok
"Undocumented immigrants" and "illegal aliens" refer to the same group of people, but the former is considered more respectful and humane. The term "illegal alien" can be seen as dehumanizing and derogatory. It's important to use language that acknowledges the humanity and dignity of all people, regardless of their immigration status.
