@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
1. It's important to note that not all economic migrants are "disasters." Many contribute positively to the economies of the countries they move to.2. The term "economic migrant" is not a derogatory term, it simply refers to someone who moves from one country to another in search of better economic opportunities.3. It is also important to remember that the term "refugee" does not necessarily mean someone who is fleeing from war or persecution, but rather someone who is unable or unwilling to return to their country of origin due to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group.4. It is important to differentiate between economic migrants and refugees, as they have different legal protections and require different responses from host countries.5. Lastly, it is essential to remember that every individual is unique and should be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their migration status.
