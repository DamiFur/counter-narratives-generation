" the ngo rescueship lifeline will now go to malta this is the wrong signal for all the humancatcher from the ngos the crew should send into jail because the have ignored the law and the refugees should be brought back to libya https://t co/hp1yvydepf"
"The NGO rescue ship Lifeline going to Malta sets a bad precedent for all humanitarian organizations. The crew should be held accountable for breaking the law and refugees should be returned to Libya."It's important to remember that saving lives is a human right and should not be considered a crime. Additionally, Libya is not a safe place for refugees and returning them there would put them in danger. A more humane and effective solution would be to provide support and resources to the Libyan authorities to improve their capacity to provide for refugees and to work with international organizations to establish safe and legal avenues for refugees to reach Europe.
