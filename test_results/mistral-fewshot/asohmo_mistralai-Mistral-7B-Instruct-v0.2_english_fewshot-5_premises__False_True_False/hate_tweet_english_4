rich african countries dont take in african migrants rich muslim countries dont take in muslim migrants rich latin american countries dont take it latin migrants but white countries are suppose to accept them ??
1. It's not a fact that only white countries are expected to accept migrants.2. Even if it were, why should they be the only ones to bear this responsibility?3. Rich countries have a moral obligation to help those in need, regardless of their race or ethnicity.4. Migration is a complex issue that requires a global solution, not a unilateral one.
