1. It is a fact that the EU spends a significant amount of money to help countries deal with refugees.2. It is also a fact that some countries, like Turkey, receive financial aid for doing so.3. However, suggesting that the only solution is to create concentration camps without food or water is not only morally reprehensible, but also a violation of international law and human rights.4. It is important to remember that the vast majority of refugees are fleeing from war, persecution, and poverty, and deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.5. Instead of resorting to hate speech and fear-mongering, we should focus on finding long-term, sustainable solutions to address the root causes of displacement and provide support to those in need.
