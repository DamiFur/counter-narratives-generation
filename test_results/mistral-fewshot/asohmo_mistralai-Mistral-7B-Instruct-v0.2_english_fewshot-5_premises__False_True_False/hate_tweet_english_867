"The world's poor" are not a monolithic group, and not all immigrants are a burden on US taxpayers. It's important to remember that immigrants also contribute to the economy and society in many ways.Additionally, the US has a long history of accepting refugees and immigrants, many of whom have gone on to make significant contributions to the country. Sending them all back would not only be inhumane, but it would also go against American values and traditions.Instead, we should focus on finding solutions that address the root causes of poverty and instability in other countries, and work to ensure that immigrants are able to integrate into American society and contribute to it in a positive way.Furthermore, it's also important to note that the U.S. has a responsibility to uphold international laws and treaties, including those related to refugees and asylum seekers.In conclusion, while it's understandable to want to protect one's own country and resources, a policy of "send them back" is not a sustainable or effective solution to the complex issue of immigration. Instead, we should strive for a more compassionate and inclusive approach that recognizes the humanity and dignity of all people, regardless of their nationality or immigration status.
