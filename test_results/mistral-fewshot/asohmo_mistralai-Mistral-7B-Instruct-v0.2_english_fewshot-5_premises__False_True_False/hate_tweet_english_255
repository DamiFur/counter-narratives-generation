1. Fact: Hispanics can be negatively affected by illegal immigration, but it's important to note that not all immigrants are illegal, and many contribute positively to the economy and society.2. Policy: Walking away from the Democrats and their supposed "socialist pro-illegal immigration policies" is not a solution to the complex issue of immigration. Instead, we should focus on comprehensive and humane immigration reform that addresses the root causes of migration and provides a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants.
