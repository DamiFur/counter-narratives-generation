"the nature of the Hispanic people is to abuse and corruptly subvert" is a generalization and a stereotype. It's not based on facts and it's not fair to judge an entire ethnicity based on the actions of a few individuals. The policy of "deport them all and build the wall" is not a solution to the complex issue of immigration and it goes against the values of inclusivity and human rights.
