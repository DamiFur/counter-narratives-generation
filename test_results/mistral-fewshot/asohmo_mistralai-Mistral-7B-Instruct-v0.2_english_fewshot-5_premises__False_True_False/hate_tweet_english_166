@user a gang of streets sellers ? this is " bbc speak " what u meant to say was third world illegal immigrants hashtag lbc
"Third world" is a term that can be considered outdated and disrespectful. Let's use "immigrants from countries with developing economies" instead.Also, not all street sellers are illegal immigrants, and not all illegal immigrants are street sellers. It's important to avoid generalizations.
