"Free speech is a fundamental human right, but it's important to remember that with that right comes responsibility. Hate speech and incitement to violence are not protected under the banner of free speech. It's crucial that we promote understanding and respect for all communities, regardless of their background or beliefs. Let's focus on building bridges, not walls." #EmbraceDiversity #EndHateSpeech #PromoteUnderstanding #RespectAllCommunities @user #StreetInterview #Migrants #BlockStreetsToPray #FreeSpeech #ResponsibilityNotHate
