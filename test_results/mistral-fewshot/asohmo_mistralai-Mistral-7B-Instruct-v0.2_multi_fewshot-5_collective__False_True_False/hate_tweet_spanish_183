"This should make every American call their senators and tell them to build the dam (wall), no chain migration, no visa lottery, and no amnesties. Corrupt Democrats can't win with hard-working Americans because they are #WalkAway from lies, #MAGA, #NoDACA."It seems like this person is advocating for building a wall, limiting immigration, and opposing amnesty for undocumented immigrants. They believe that doing so will help "hard-working Americans" and prevent "corrupt Democrats" from winning. The hashtags "#WalkAway" and "#MAGA" suggest a connection to the "Walk Away" movement, which encourages people to leave the Democratic Party, and the "Make America Great Again" slogan associated with Donald Trump's presidency.
