"Frontex ships, NGO ships, and criminal elements are transporting refugees from Africa to Europe, and it's a good business for them because only a few European governments are willing and able to prevent refugees from entering their territory."It's important to clarify that not all refugees are illegally entering Europe, and many are fleeing war, persecution, and other forms of violence. It's also important to note that the vast majority of refugees are not involved in criminal activities, and that the smuggling of refugees is a complex issue that requires a comprehensive and humane response.Counter-narrative:"Frontex, NGOs, and legal channels are working together to ensure that refugees are able to reach Europe safely and in a dignified manner. Many European countries are welcoming refugees with open arms and providing them with the support they need to rebuild their lives. Let's focus on the positive actions being taken to help refugees, rather than spreading fear and misinformation."
