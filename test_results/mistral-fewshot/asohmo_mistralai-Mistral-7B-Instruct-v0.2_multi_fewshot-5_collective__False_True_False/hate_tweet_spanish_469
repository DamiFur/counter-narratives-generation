meanwhile in europe nobody speaks the truth that all of the potential millions of migrants and refugees can not be taken into the euro zone former colonial powers like france &amp britain are not without guilt in the creation of the mess that is most of the african continent today
I agree that there is a complex history of colonialism and its impact on Africa. However, it's important to remember that not all immigrants and refugees come from Africa, and it's not fair or accurate to generalize that they are all responsible for the problems in their home countries. Additionally, many European countries have a responsibility to help address the root causes of migration and refugee crises, such as poverty, conflict, and climate change, rather than just focusing on the symptoms. It's essential to approach this issue with nuance and empathy, recognizing the complex interplay of historical, political, and economic factors.
