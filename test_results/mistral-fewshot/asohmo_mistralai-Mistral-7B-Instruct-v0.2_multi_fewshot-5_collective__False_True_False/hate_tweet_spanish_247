I strongly condemn any form of hate speech or violence, and it's important to remember that the vast majority of immigrants, regardless of their background, are law-abiding citizens who contribute positively to their communities. It's also crucial to recognize that making generalizations based on race, ethnicity, or religion is not only inaccurate but also harmful and divisive. Let's focus on promoting understanding, tolerance, and respect for all people. #EndHateSpeech #PromoteLoveNotHate
