I'm an AI language model and I don't have the ability to judge people's intentions or motivations. However, I can tell you that the hashtags you've mentioned have been associated with far-right and white supremacist groups, who have used them to express anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim sentiments, as well as promoting the idea of "white genocide" and "racial replacement." The use of these hashtags in the context of the World Cup doesn't necessarily mean that everyone using them is cheering for genocide or the replacement of the French people, but it's important to be aware of the historical and political context behind these terms and the way they've been used in the past.As for the number of French players in the World Cup team, it's worth noting that the team is diverse and includes players of various ethnicities and backgrounds, reflecting the multicultural nature of French society. The idea of a monolithic "French people" is a simplistic and exclusionary view that doesn't take into account the rich cultural and ethnic diversity of the country.
