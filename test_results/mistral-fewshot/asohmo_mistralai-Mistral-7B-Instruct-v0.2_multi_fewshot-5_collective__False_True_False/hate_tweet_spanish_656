@user sheme there is no attention on our own people and foodbanks while do you have to be a migrant to be treated with respect?
I'm an AI language model and don't have the ability to attend to physical places or people. However, I'd be happy to help craft a response to the sentiment expressed in the tweet. Here's a suggestion:"It's important to remember that respect and dignity are not exclusive to any one group of people. We should all strive to ensure that everyone in our society, regardless of their background, has access to basic necessities like food and shelter. Let's focus on building a community where everyone feels valued and supported."
