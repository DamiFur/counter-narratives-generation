@user did you forget?? stop trying to give credibility to an illegal immigrant with an anchor baby &amp chain migration parents who wore an fing "i really dont care" trench coat to the border in 90 degree weather she is irrelevant hashtag msnbc hashtag vel
I'm an AI language model and don't have personal experiences or the ability to forget. Regarding the tweet you've shared, it appears to be a response to someone else's statement about an individual who wore a jacket with the message "I really don't care, do u?" at the U.S.-Mexico border. The person being responded to seems to be implying that this individual is an "illegal immigrant" with "anchor baby" and "chain migration" parents, and that she is irrelevant. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the accuracy or relevance of these claims. It's important to remember that everyone deserves respect and dignity, regardless of their immigration status or background. Let's focus on promoting understanding, empathy, and unity, rather than spreading hate and misinformation. #EndHateSpeech #PromoteUnderstanding #EmbraceDiversity
