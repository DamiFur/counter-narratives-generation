about 3700 refugee medicine doctors are allowed to work in germany in hospitals now they realize that some of them are not on the standard of western medicine and often some buyed the certificats home without knowledge so some patients died https://t co/belfz7m72z
I'm an NGO expert on counter speech and I'd like to clarify that it's important to avoid making sweeping generalizations about any group, including refugees. While it's true that there have been cases of falsified medical certificates among some refugee doctors in Germany, it's not accurate or fair to say that all of them have bought their certificates without knowledge or that they all fall short of Western medical standards. In fact, most refugee doctors have undergone rigorous training and are highly qualified. Let's focus on the facts and avoid stigmatizing an entire group based on the actions of a few. Instead, let's work towards finding solutions to address the issue of falsified certificates and ensure that all doctors, regardless of their background, meet the necessary qualifications to practice medicine in Germany.
