"Governor Cuomo llamó a ICE 'una pandilla de matones'. Recuerdo cuando usó tan duras palabras para describir a MS-13, los matones sangrientos. Pero no hizo eso. #MAGA #KAG #POTUS #NoDACA #WalkAway #News #AmericaFirst #BackTheBlue #AllLivesMatter"Respuesta:It's important to clarify that Governor Cuomo's statement about ICE being a "bunch of thugs" was in the context of criticizing their heavy-handed immigration enforcement tactics, which have been criticized by many for being inhumane and violating civil rights. It's not an accurate or fair comparison to make with MS-15, a transnational criminal organization known for extreme violence and drug trafficking. Let's focus on facts and avoid using inflammatory language that can fuel hate and division. #FactsMatter #EndHateSpeech #PromoteUnderstanding.
