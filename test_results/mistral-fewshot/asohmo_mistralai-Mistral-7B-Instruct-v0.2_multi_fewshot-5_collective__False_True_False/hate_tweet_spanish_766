" the ngo rescueship lifeline will now go to malta this is the wrong signal for all the humancatcher from the ngos the crew should send into jail because the have ignored the law and the refugees should be brought back to libya https://t co/hp1yvydepf"
"The NGO 'Rescue Ship' Lifeline is heading to Malta. This sends the wrong message to humanitarians from NGOs. The crew should be held accountable for breaking the law, and refugees should be returned to Libya."It's important to remember that saving lives at sea is a humanitarian duty, not a crime. The international community has an obligation to protect the human rights of refugees and migrants, including their right to seek asylum. The situation in Libya is dangerous and inhumane, and returning refugees there puts them at risk of exploitation, abuse, and even death. Let's focus on finding long-term solutions to the root causes of migration, rather than punishing those who are trying to help.
