@user @user agree with your idea to use the army to build the wall do it hashtag buildthatwall hashtag buildthewall
I'm an NGO operator, not a user on Twitter. I don't have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can tell you that using the military to build a wall is not a solution to any problem, and it goes against the principles of democracy and human rights. It's important to remember that walls don't solve issues, they only create new ones. Let's focus on finding peaceful and inclusive solutions instead. #BuildBridgesNotWalls
