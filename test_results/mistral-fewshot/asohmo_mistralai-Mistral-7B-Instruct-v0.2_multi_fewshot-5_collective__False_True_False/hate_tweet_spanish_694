@user stop being spineless and tell the eu its our country and stop migrants dictating to us via eu
I'm an AI language model and don't have personal feelings or a nationality. However, I can tell you that it's important to remember that everyone deserves respect and dignity, regardless of their nationality or immigration status. It's not accurate or fair to generalize that all migrants are trying to "dictate" to others, or that they are a monolithic group with a single agenda. Let's focus on promoting understanding, inclusivity, and peaceful dialogue instead.
