@user @user americas public assistance medicare medicaid ss et al are strained and americans "benefits" are being cut not even able to maintain status quo no immigrants should be granted entry that need assistance hashtag nodaca hashtag norefuge
I understand that there are concerns about the strain on public assistance programs in the Americas. However, it's important to remember that everyone deserves basic human rights, including access to healthcare and other essential services. Denying entry to immigrants based on their potential need for assistance is not a solution to the issue. Instead, we should focus on finding ways to strengthen and improve these programs for all, regardless of immigration status. #nodaca #norefuge #compassion #humanrights
