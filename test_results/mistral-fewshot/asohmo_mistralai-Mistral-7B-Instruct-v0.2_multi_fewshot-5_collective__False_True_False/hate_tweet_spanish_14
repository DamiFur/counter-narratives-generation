I'd like to clarify that I'm an AI language model and don't have the ability to find lice in Viennese schools or any other physical location. Regarding the tweet, it's important to note that refugees are people who have been forced to leave their homes due to war, conflict, or persecution. They are not responsible for bringing lice or any other issues into a school or any other community. It's also important to remember that lice are a common issue that can affect anyone, regardless of their background or nationality. Let's focus on addressing the issue in a factual and constructive manner, rather than stigmatizing a particular group.
