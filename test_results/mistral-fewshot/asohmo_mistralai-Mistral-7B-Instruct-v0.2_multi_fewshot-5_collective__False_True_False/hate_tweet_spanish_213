"44.6% in CA don't speak English at home" is not an accurate representation of the data from the U.S. Census Bureau. The actual percentage of households in California where a language other than English is spoken is around 47%. However, it's important to note that not speaking English at home doesn't mean someone isn't fluent in English or can't speak it well. Additionally, schools receive funding based on the number of students they have, not based on their English proficiency. Immigration is a complex issue with many factors, and it's not accurate or fair to blame it for the funding of schools or the lack of English proficiency in certain areas. Let's promote understanding and inclusivity instead of fear and division.
