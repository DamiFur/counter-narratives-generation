so the economic migration crisis will now get rapidly worse into 2021 and anyone opining that a province like ontario can absorb a million people into the social infrastructure is not understanding the macro events underway and the system collapse that would trigger
"Macro events underway" and "system collapse" are broad and vague terms that can be interpreted in many ways. It's important to remember that immigration is a complex issue with many factors at play, including economic, social, and political considerations. While it's true that absorbing a large number of people into a province's social infrastructure can be challenging, it's also important to consider the long-term benefits that immigration can bring to a community, such as economic growth, cultural diversity, and a larger workforce.It's also worth noting that there are ways to manage immigration in a responsible and sustainable way. For example, provinces and countries can invest in building the necessary infrastructure to support new immigrants, such as housing, schools, and healthcare facilities. They can also implement policies to ensure that new immigrants are able to integrate into the labor market and contribute to the economy as soon as possible.Ultimately, the key to managing immigration effectively is to approach it as a long-term investment, rather than a short-term challenge. By planning ahead and investing in the necessary infrastructure and policies, provinces can not only absorb large numbers of immigrants, but also reap the benefits that come with a diverse and vibrant population.
