regardless of intent the term " undocumented immigrant " is incorrect because illegal aliens are foreigners (i e aliens ) who are unlawfully present in the united states (i e illegal) https://t co/aarjtduwya https://t co/hkrv7mpzok
"Illegal alien" is a term used to describe a foreign national who is present in a country without proper authorization or documentation. While some people may view this term as derogatory, it is a legal and accurate term. However, it's important to remember that the vast majority of undocumented immigrants are hardworking individuals who came to the U.S. in search of a better life for themselves and their families. They contribute to our communities and our economy, and they deserve respect and dignity, regardless of their immigration status. Let's focus on finding solutions to the complex issue of immigration reform, rather than stigmatizing and demonizing individuals based on their status. #ImmigrationReform #DignityForAll #EndHateSpeech
