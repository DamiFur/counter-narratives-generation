comparatively our own inner city youth & fellow americans live like 3rd class citizens while illegals are housed at ice centers that rival the best elementary schools & college dorms in the country hashtag buildthatwall @user @user @user @user @user
"Inner city youth" and "illegals" are not the same group of people. It's important to remember that every individual has the right to basic human rights and dignity, regardless of their immigration status or socioeconomic background. Building a wall will not solve the complex issues of poverty and inequality that exist in our society. Instead, we should focus on policies that address the root causes of these issues and ensure that everyone has access to the resources and opportunities they need to thrive.
