"Happy Labor Day to all legal American workers! Shame on illegal workers for stealing SSNs and IDs to take jobs from Americans and lower wages. #MAGA #SendThemBack #LaborDay"This tweet expresses anger and frustration towards illegal workers, accusing them of stealing Social Security numbers (SSNs) and identification documents to take jobs away from Americans, lowering wages in the process. The tweet also includes the hashtag #MAGA, which is associated with the Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement and its political ideology.Counter-narrative:"Labor Day is a time to celebrate the hard work and contributions of all workers, regardless of their immigration status. It's important to remember that the vast majority of undocumented immigrants pay taxes, contribute to their communities, and are an integral part of the American workforce. Let's focus on comprehensive immigration reform that addresses the root causes of migration and provides a pathway to legal status for undocumented workers. #FairLaborForAll #ImmigrantContributions"
