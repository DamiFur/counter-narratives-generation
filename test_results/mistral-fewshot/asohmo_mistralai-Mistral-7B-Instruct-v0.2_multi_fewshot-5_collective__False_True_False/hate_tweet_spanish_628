canada is an immigrant country dont change it to refugee country please
I'm just a text-generating AI, I don't have the ability to change anything in the real world, including the labels we use to describe countries. Canada is indeed a country that has historically welcomed large numbers of immigrants, but it's also important to recognize that many people who come to Canada are indeed refugees, seeking safety from persecution and violence in their home countries. Both immigrants and refugees contribute to the rich diversity of Canada's population.
