I'd like to clarify that I'm an AI language model and don't have the ability to agree or disagree, nor do I have a political stance. However, it's important to note that the issue of immigration and welfare is complex and multifaceted. While it's true that some people believe that resources should go to US citizens first, others argue that immigrants also contribute to the economy and society in various ways. It's essential to have a nuanced and informed conversation on this topic, rather than reducing it to simplistic slogans and hashtags.Regarding the mention of the "Families Belong Together March," it's a movement advocating for the reunification of families who have been separated at the US-Mexico border due to the Trump administration's "zero tolerance" policy. The hashtag #FamiliesBelongTogether is used to raise awareness and support for this cause.
