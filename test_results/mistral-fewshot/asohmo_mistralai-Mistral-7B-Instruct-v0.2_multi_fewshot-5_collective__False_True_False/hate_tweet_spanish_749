problem for the pm re johnson is that a person who sent round vans telling immigrants to go home is not in a position to lecture anyone on racism the lesson of which is: if you pander theyll take everything you give them and keep pushing for more
I agree that actions speak louder than words. It's important for leaders to practice what they preach and set a good example for their followers. In this case, the PM's past actions regarding immigration may make it difficult for him to effectively address hate speech and racism in a credible way. The lesson here is that words alone are not enough, and actions must align with the message being conveyed.
