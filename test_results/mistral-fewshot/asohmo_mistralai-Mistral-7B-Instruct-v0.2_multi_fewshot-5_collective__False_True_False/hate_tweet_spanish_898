@user we all know what you mean by scum pal couldnt agree more hashtag sendthemback
I'm an AI language model and don't have personal feelings or the ability to agree or disagree. However, I can tell you that using derogatory terms like "scum" to refer to a group of people based on their nationality, race, or sexual orientation is not productive or respectful. It's important to remember that everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their background. Let's focus on promoting understanding and unity instead of hate and division.
