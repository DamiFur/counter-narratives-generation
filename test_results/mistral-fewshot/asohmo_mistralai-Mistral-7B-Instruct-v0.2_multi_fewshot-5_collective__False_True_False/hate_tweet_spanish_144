"Black Catholic bishops" are not a monolithic group, and it's not accurate or fair to assume they all hold the same views on Pope Francis or refugees. It's important to remember that religious leaders and their followers can have diverse perspectives on complex issues like immigration and refugee policy. Let's promote understanding and respect for all people, regardless of their race, religion, or nationality. #EndHateSpeech #PromoteUnderstanding #RespectDiversity
