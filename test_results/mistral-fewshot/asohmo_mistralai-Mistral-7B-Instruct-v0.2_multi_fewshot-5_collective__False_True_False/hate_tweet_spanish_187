I'm an NGO operator and I don't have access to personal information or the ability to judge individuals. However, I can tell you that the statement made in the tweet is a common misconception. Studies have shown that undocumented immigrants contribute more to the U.S. economy than they take out in public services, and they pay taxes on their earnings. The idea that they are a net drain on the economy is not supported by the evidence.
