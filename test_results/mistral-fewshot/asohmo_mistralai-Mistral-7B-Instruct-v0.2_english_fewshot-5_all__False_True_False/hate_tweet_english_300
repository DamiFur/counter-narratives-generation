iranians either entered via greece or serbia which recklessly grants visas to iranians some iranians now fly into serbia ðÿ‰then leave for richer state in eu indirect support of illegal migration must end or others must impose sanctions on serbia to adjust attitude @user https://t co/pzhlgojaxc
1. It's important to note that not all Iranians entering Europe illegally are doing so through Serbia, and that many are fleeing war and persecution.2. Sanctions may not be an effective solution, as they can have unintended consequences and may harm innocent civilians.3. A more constructive approach would be to work with Serbian authorities to improve border security and address the root causes of illegal migration, such as conflict and poverty in Iran and other countries of origin.4. Additionally, it's essential to remember that the vast majority of Iranians are law-abiding citizens who contribute positively to their communities, and it's important not to stigmatize or stereotype them based on the actions of a few.
