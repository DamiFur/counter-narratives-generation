1. It's important to remember that not all illegal immigrants are a burden on society. Many contribute to the economy and pay taxes.2. Deporting people and separating families is not a humane solution and goes against American values.3. A more comprehensive approach, such as reforming the immigration system, would be more effective in addressing the issue.
