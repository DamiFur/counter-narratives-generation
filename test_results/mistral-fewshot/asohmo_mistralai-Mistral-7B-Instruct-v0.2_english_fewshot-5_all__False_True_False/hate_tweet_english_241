1. It's important to remember that not all undocumented immigrants receive welfare, and many contribute to the economy through work and taxes.2. The statement "families belong together" is often used to argue for keeping families together in detention centers, rather than separating them at the border. Separating families is not a solution to the issue of illegal immigration, and it's not what the "Families Belong Together" movement is about.3. The hashtag #votedemsout is often used by those who oppose the Democratic Party and want to express their support for other political parties or candidates.A more balanced and nuanced response could be: "While it's true that some Americans share @user's views on immigration, it's also important to consider the complexities of the issue and the potential consequences of policies that target undocumented individuals. Not all immigrants receive welfare and many contribute significantly to the economy. Additionally, separating families at the border is not a viable solution and goes against the values of compassion and human rights. Let's focus on finding long-term, humane solutions to address the root causes of illegal immigration and ensure that all individuals, regardless of their immigration status, have access to the resources and opportunities they need to thrive."
