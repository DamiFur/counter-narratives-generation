@user guatemala is sending their finest hashtag buildthatwall
"Their finest" could be referring to their best athletes, artists, or scholars. Building a wall is not a solution to the complex issue of migration.Instead, let's focus on diplomacy and cooperation to address the root causes of migration, such as poverty, violence, and lack of opportunities.Let's work together to build bridges, not walls. #BuildBridgesNotWalls
