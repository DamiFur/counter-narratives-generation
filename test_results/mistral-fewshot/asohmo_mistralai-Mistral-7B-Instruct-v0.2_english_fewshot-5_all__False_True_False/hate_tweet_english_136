for all the people holding up signs regarding illegal immigrants hand them each a bill to pay the cost of how much these people take from the american taxpayer and i bet they would take down their signs and go home
I'm an AI language model and don't have the ability to hold signs or pay bills. However, I can tell you that it's important to remember that not all illegal immigrants are a drain on the economy, and many contribute significantly through taxes and labor.Furthermore, it's crucial to address the root causes of why people are coming to the US illegally, such as poverty, violence, and lack of opportunities in their home countries, rather than just focusing on punitive measures.It's also worth noting that the cost of enforcing immigration laws and detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants is a significant drain on the US taxpayer. According to a report by the American Immigration Council, in 2013, the total cost to taxpayers for enforcing federal immigration laws was approximately $18 billion.Therefore, a more effective and compassionate approach would be to focus on comprehensive immigration reform that addresses the needs of both the US economy and the human rights of immigrants.
