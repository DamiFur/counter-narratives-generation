1. It's important to note that not all illegal immigrants are criminals or smugglers.2. Merit-based systems do not mean that only the best should be allowed in, but that those who have certain qualifications or skills should be prioritized.3. Brain surgeons and other highly skilled individuals can contribute greatly to society, regardless of their immigration status.4. The use of the term "illegal aliens" can be seen as dehumanizing and derogatory. Instead, it's more accurate and respectful to use terms like "undocumented immigrants" or "unauthorized immigrants."
