@user @user string him up to show the message that you will pay for your crimes in a country where you are not supposed to be in hashtag buildthatwall we are losing our legal citizens to those who should not be here in the first place if they werent here we would still have our loved ones
"Stringing up" someone is a violent and inhumane action. It's not a solution to any problem, especially not to the issue of illegal immigration.Moreover, it's important to remember that the vast majority of undocumented immigrants are not violent criminals, but rather hardworking individuals who came to the US in search of a better life for themselves and their families.Instead of promoting hate and violence, we should focus on finding compassionate and effective solutions to address the root causes of illegal immigration and provide a pathway to legal status for those who are already here.Building a wall and separating families is not the answer. We need comprehensive immigration reform that recognizes the human dignity of all people, regardless of their immigration status.
