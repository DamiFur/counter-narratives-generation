"Commie" is a derogatory term for someone who supports communism. It's important to remember that not all people from countries with socialist or communist governments identify as communists themselves.Moreover, being into Putin doesn't make someone a communist. Putin is the leader of Russia, which is a federal semi-presidential republic, not a communist country.Regarding the second part of your statement, there are indeed lawyers in countries with communist or socialist governments. The legal profession is not dependent on the political system of a country. Laws and legal systems can vary greatly from one country to another, but the role of lawyers remains the same: to provide legal advice and representation to their clients.
