@user must deport all illegal migrants india already reeling under constant threat of muslim radicals curb population
"Muslim radicals" is a broad and vague term. Not all Muslims are radicals, and not all illegal immigrants are Muslims. It's important to remember that individuals cannot be judged based on their race, religion, or nationality alone. Deportation should be based on the individual's legal status, not their ethnicity or religious beliefs.
