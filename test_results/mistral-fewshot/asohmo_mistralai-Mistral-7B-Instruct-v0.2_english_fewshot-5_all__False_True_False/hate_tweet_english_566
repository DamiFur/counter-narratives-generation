@user @user agree with your idea to use the army to build the wall do it hashtag buildthatwall hashtag buildthewall
1. Using the military to build a wall goes against the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which forbids the federal military from engaging in law enforcement within the United States, except in cases expressly authorized by the Constitution or Congress.2. Building a wall using the military would be a costly and inefficient solution, as the military does not have the expertise or resources to construct a wall effectively.3. The use of the military for such a purpose would set a dangerous precedent, potentially leading to the militarization of domestic policy and the erosion of civil liberties.Therefore, it is not a wise or feasible solution to the issue at hand. Instead, a more effective and constitutional approach would be to work with Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform that addresses the root causes of illegal immigration and provides a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants already living in the United States.
