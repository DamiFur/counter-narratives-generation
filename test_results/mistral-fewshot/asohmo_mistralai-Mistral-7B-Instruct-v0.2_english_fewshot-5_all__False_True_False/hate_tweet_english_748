hungary referendum: 98% of voters reject islamic immigration - muslims are offended - free speech time - https://t co/dlnslapka7 @user
1. It's important to remember that not all Muslims support Islamic immigration, and not all Hungarians who voted against Islamic immigration are anti-Muslim.2. The fact that some Muslims are offended by the referendum result does not justify hate speech or discrimination against them.3. Free speech is a fundamental human right, but it should not be used to spread hate or incite violence.4. It is essential to promote understanding, respect, and dialogue between different communities to build a more inclusive and peaceful society.
