"Illegals" are human beings, deserving of basic human rights and dignity, regardless of their legal status. Education is a fundamental right, as established by the Supreme Court in the case of Mendez v. Westminster School District (1946) and more recently in Plyler v. Doe (1982).Furthermore, it is important to remember that the vast majority of undocumented immigrants are not violent criminals, but rather hardworking individuals who contribute significantly to our economy and society.Therefore, it is not only morally right, but also in the best interest of our country to provide them with access to education and other essential services, rather than demonizing and stigmatizing them.
