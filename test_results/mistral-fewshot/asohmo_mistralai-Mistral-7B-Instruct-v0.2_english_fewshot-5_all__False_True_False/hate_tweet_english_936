"The Hillary email scandal and the unmasking of US citizens by the FBI, CIA, and DOJ is indeed a significant issue, but it's important to remember that it's not the only scandal in American politics. While it's true that there were allegations of perjury and obstruction, it's also important to consider the context and evidence surrounding these allegations. Additionally, the term 'silent coup' is a loaded term and may not accurately reflect the facts of the situation. It's always important to approach political discourse with a critical and informed perspective."
