@user tough decisions mean easy ones ban those families who supported isis in germany they murdered many and if you do not learn from recent events like mass immigration rises in rape and crime family isis deserve no return to the country the
1. It's important to differentiate between individuals and entire groups. Not all immigrants, or even all members of a particular group, are responsible for the actions of a few.2. Banishing an entire family based on the actions of one or a few members is a disproportionate response and a violation of human rights.3. There is no credible evidence to support the claim that mass immigration leads to a significant increase in rape or crime. In fact, studies have shown that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens in many countries.4. It is also important to consider the potential consequences of such a policy, including the impact on community cohesion, human rights, and international relations.5. A more effective approach would be to focus on addressing the root causes of violent extremism, such as poverty, lack of education, and social marginalization, and to work with communities to build resilience and prevent radicalization.6. It is important to remember that every individual deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or actions of their family members.
