black catolic bishops are against their pope franciscus they dont want to loose their sheep which like to go to europe as refugees in the meantime hypocrises franciscus pray and dont open the st petersdom for refugees to stay https://t co/vxiffbao55
1. It's important to note that the Pope's decision to not open St. Peter's Basilica to refugees is not a personal attack on the refugees themselves, but rather a complex political and logistical issue.2. The statement that "black Catholic bishops" are against Pope Francis is a generalization and oversimplification. The Catholic Church is a global institution with diverse perspectives and opinions, and it's not accurate to assume that all black Catholic leaders hold the same views on this issue.3. The use of the term "sheep" to refer to refugees is derogatory and dehumanizing. Refugees are human beings in need of protection and assistance, not a herd to be owned or controlled.4. The assertion that refugees "like to go to Europe" is a stereotype and an oversimplification of the complex reasons why people flee their home countries and seek refuge in other parts of the world.Instead of spreading hate and division, let's focus on finding compassionate and effective solutions to address the root causes of displacement and provide support and protection to those in need.
