@user i just read the guy that broke into many homes including chef jaime oliver was let go but dont call a refugee a rapefugee or the soros sponsored police of the uk will not let you go
"Rapefugee" is a derogatory term used to stigmatize refugees. It's important to remember that the actions of a few individuals should not be used to stereotype and discriminate against an entire group. Let's focus on the facts and not resort to hate speech.Regarding the second part of your statement, there is no evidence to support the claim that George Soros sponsors the police in the UK. This is a common conspiracy theory with no factual basis.
