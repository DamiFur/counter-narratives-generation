@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
1. Not all economic migrants pose as refugees, and not all refugees are economic migrants.2. Many refugees don't have the means or safety to travel to Europe directly, and Turkey is not a safe haven for them.3. It's not fair to generalize and stigmatize an entire group based on the actions of a few.4. Europe has a responsibility to help those in need, regardless of their reasons for seeking asylum.5. A more nuanced and compassionate approach is needed to address the root causes of migration and find long-term solutions.
