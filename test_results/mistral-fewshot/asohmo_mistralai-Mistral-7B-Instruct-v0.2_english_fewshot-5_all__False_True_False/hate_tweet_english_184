"Families Belong Together" is a campaign against separating families at the border. It doesn't differentiate between legal and illegal immigrants in this context.However, it's important to remember that not all illegal immigrants come as families, and not all families are illegal immigrants. It's a complex issue with many nuances that can't be summed up in a hashtag or a tweet.
