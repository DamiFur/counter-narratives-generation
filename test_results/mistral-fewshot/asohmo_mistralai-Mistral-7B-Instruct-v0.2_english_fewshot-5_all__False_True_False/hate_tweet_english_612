@user @user @user @user a very high wall must be build to protect usa from bad elements of illigal refugees
"Bad elements" are not exclusive to illegal refugees. Building a wall will not solve the problem, it will only create more issues.Instead, let's focus on addressing the root causes of why people are forced to leave their homes and become refugees in the first place. Let's work towards creating a world where everyone can live in peace and safety, regardless of their nationality or immigration status.Furthermore, it's important to remember that the vast majority of refugees are not "bad elements," but rather innocent people who have been displaced from their homes due to conflict, persecution, or natural disasters.Let's promote understanding, compassion, and solidarity, rather than fear and division. #BuildBridgesNotWalls #RefugeesWelcome #HumanRightsForAll
