1. It's important to remember that not all illegal immigrants use children as a get-out-of-jail-card, and not all children of illegal immigrants are complicit in their parents' actions.2. The use of the term "illegals" can be seen as dehumanizing and derogatory. Instead, it's more accurate and respectful to refer to them as "undocumented immigrants" or "unauthorized immigrants."3. The policy of detaining and deporting all undocumented immigrants, especially those with children, can have negative consequences on families and communities. It can also be costly and time-consuming for law enforcement and taxpayers.4. A more humane and effective approach would be to provide a pathway to legal status for those who meet certain criteria, such as having lived in the US for a certain period of time, paying taxes, and passing a background check. This would allow them to contribute to society and live without fear of deportation.5. Additionally, addressing the root causes of immigration, such as poverty, violence, and lack of opportunities in their home countries, can help reduce the number of people leaving and coming to the US illegally.
