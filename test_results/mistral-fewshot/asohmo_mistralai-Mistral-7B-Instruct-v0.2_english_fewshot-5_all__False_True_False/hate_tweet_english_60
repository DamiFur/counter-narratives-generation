@user for god sake dont put india to danger by unchecked appeasement of ur special community illegal migrants nation is supreme
"Special community" is a vague term. It's important to remember that every individual deserves respect and dignity, regardless of their background.Furthermore, it's crucial to approach this issue with empathy and understanding, rather than fear and hate. Let's focus on finding solutions that benefit everyone involved, rather than stoking division and xenophobia.It's also important to note that the term "illegal migrants" can be seen as derogatory and dehumanizing. Instead, let's refer to them as "undocumented immigrants" or "migrants without proper documentation."Let's work towards a more inclusive and compassionate society, rather than fueling hate and fear.
