this should be every country they come here seeking asylum better life then become a burden to our financials system and criminal system why do we allow this hashtag deport them all no respect for hashtag america @user hashtag buildthatwall hashtag maga hashtag patriotsunited hashtag apologytourisover
1. It's important to remember that not all asylum seekers become burdens, and many contribute positively to society.2. Building a wall won't solve the problem, as there are other ways for people to enter a country.3. Deportation is a complex issue, and it's not as simple as "deport them all." Each case should be evaluated individually.4. Respect for America doesn't come from excluding people, but from treating everyone with dignity and compassion.
