"Racial replacement" and "genocide" are extreme and inflammatory terms. It's important to remember that the vast majority of immigrants are peaceful, law-abiding citizens who contribute positively to their new communities.Regarding the factual part of your statement, it would be helpful to know the context of the tweet and the source of the information about the number of French players in the World Cup team.However, even if a significant number of players were indeed foreign-born, it does not mean that they are a threat to the French people or that they are responsible for any supposed "invasion" or "replacement" of the French population.Furthermore, the term "white pride" is often associated with white supremacist and racist ideologies, and it is important to reject such hateful and divisive rhetoric.Instead, we should focus on promoting unity, understanding, and respect for all people, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or national origin. We should also work to address the root causes of migration and ensure that immigrants are welcomed and integrated into their new communities in a positive and inclusive way.
