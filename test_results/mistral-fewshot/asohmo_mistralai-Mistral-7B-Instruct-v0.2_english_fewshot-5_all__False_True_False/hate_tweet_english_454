1. It's important to remember that not all undocumented immigrants are criminals or a burden on society.2. Deporting all illegal immigrants, including DACA recipients, would have significant social and economic consequences.3. Instead, a more effective approach would be to focus on comprehensive immigration reform that addresses the root causes of illegal immigration and provides a pathway to legal status for those who meet certain requirements.4. Additionally, resources could be allocated to improve border security and address the issue of sanctuary cities, chain migration, and the Diversity Visa Lottery in a fair and equitable manner.5. Mandatory verification systems could also be implemented to ensure that employers are not knowingly hiring undocumented workers, reducing the incentive for illegal immigration.6. Ultimately, a more compassionate and sensible approach is needed to address the complex issue of illegal immigration, rather than resorting to hateful and divisive rhetoric.
