@user will islam ever be at peace with its self as it goes to war with itsel f no wonder uk people do not accept its refugees
1. It's important to note that not all Muslims support or engage in violence.2. The UK has a responsibility to help those in need, regardless of their religion or ethnicity.3. The situation in some Muslim-majority countries is complex and multifaceted, and it's not fair to generalize the entire religion based on the actions of a few.4. The UK's decision to accept or reject refugees should be based on humanitarian grounds, not on fear or prejudice.
