1. The judge's statement does not equate to him being on crack.2. The cost of illegal immigration and the taxes they pay are two different things.3. The overall impact of illegal immigrants on the economy is a complex issue and cannot be summarized as "no benefit" or "cost."4. It's important to consider the long-term economic, social, and moral implications of immigration policies.5. Let's focus on finding solutions that benefit everyone involved, rather than spreading hate and misinformation.
