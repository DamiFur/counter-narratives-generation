@user sheme there is no attention on our own people and foodbanks while do you have to be a migrant to be treated with respect?
1. Attention and resources should be distributed fairly and equitably, regardless of one's nationality or immigration status.2. Respect is a basic human right that should be afforded to all individuals, regardless of their background or circumstances.3. It's important to address the root causes of why some people may feel neglected or disrespected, rather than scapegoating certain groups.4. Creating a culture of empathy and understanding can help bridge divides and foster a more inclusive society.
