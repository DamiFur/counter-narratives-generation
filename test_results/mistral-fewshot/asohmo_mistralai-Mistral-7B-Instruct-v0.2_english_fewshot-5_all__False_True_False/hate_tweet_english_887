1. It's important to remember that the actions of a few individuals should not be generalized to an entire group.2. Building a wall is not a solution to the complex issue of immigration.3. We should focus on addressing the root causes of violence and crime, rather than scapegoating a particular group.4. We should also remember that most immigrants, including asylum seekers, are law-abiding citizens who contribute positively to society.5. Instead of building walls, we should be building bridges of understanding and cooperation between different communities.6. Let's work together to find comprehensive and humane solutions to the challenges of immigration, rather than resorting to hateful rhetoric and divisive policies.
