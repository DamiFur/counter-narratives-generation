1. It's important for leaders to protect their borders, but it's also crucial to respect human rights and international law.2. Not all migrants pose a threat, many are fleeing from war, persecution, and poverty.3. The term "roaming northward" can be seen as dehumanizing and stigmatizing towards migrants.4. Orban's actions towards migrants have been criticized for being xenophobic and violating human rights.5. A more effective and humane approach would be to work with other European countries and international organizations to address the root causes of migration and provide safe and legal avenues for people to seek asylum.
