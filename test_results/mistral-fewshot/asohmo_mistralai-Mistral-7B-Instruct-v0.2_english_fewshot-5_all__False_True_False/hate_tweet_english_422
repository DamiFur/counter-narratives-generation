1. It's important to remember that not all Hispanics agree with this statement.2. Illegal immigration is a complex issue with many causes and consequences, and it's not fair to oversimplify it.3. There are also other factors that impact wages, jobs, and communities for Hispanics and other groups, such as economic policies, education, and access to opportunities.4. The solution should focus on addressing the root causes of illegal immigration and finding a fair and humane solution for those who are already here.5. Let's not forget that many Hispanics are also immigrants or descendants of immigrants, and they know firsthand the challenges of coming to a new country and building a better life for themselves and their families.6. Instead of focusing on hate and division, let's work together to find solutions that benefit everyone.
