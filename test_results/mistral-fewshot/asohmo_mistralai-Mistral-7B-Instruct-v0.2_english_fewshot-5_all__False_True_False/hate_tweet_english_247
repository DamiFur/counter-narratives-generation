@user seems isis rape document is being followed by young male arabs immigrants and others in germany add france no respect no entry
1. It's important to remember that the actions of a few individuals should not be generalized to an entire group.2. This statement does not provide any evidence that the ISIS rape document is the only or even the main reason for the behavior of young male Arab immigrants in Germany and France.3. The statement "no respect no entry" is a call for exclusion and discrimination, which is not a solution to the problem of crime or violence.4. It is essential to address the root causes of criminal behavior, such as poverty, lack of education, and social exclusion, rather than stigmatizing entire groups based on their ethnicity or nationality.5. It is also crucial to remember that many immigrants contribute positively to their new communities and that the vast majority of immigrants do not commit crimes at a higher rate than the native-born population.6. It is important to promote understanding, tolerance, and respect for all individuals, regardless of their background, and to work together to create safe and inclusive communities for everyone.
