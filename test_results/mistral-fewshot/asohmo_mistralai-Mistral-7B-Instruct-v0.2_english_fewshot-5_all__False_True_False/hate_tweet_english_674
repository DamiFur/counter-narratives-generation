@user unchecked population &amp migration to cities is biggest evil for dirty india disincentive large families such as withdrawl of sops
"Unchecked population and migration to cities" is a complex issue with many causes and consequences. It's not fair to blame just one group for it.Moreover, "disincentivizing large families" and "withdrawing sops" might not be an effective or fair solution to the problem.It's important to consider the root causes of population growth and urbanization, such as poverty, lack of education and employment opportunities, and inadequate infrastructure. Addressing these issues could help reduce the pressure on cities and improve living conditions for everyone.Additionally, it's essential to remember that every person, regardless of where they come from, has the right to live in a clean and healthy environment. Blaming "illegal aliens" or "migrants" for the problems in a country is not a solution, but rather a way to divert attention from the real issues.Instead of focusing on punishing certain groups, let's work together to find long-term, sustainable solutions that benefit everyone.
