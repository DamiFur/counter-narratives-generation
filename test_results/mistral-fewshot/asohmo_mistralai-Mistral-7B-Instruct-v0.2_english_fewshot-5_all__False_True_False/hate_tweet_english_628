canada is an immigrant country dont change it to refugee country please
Immigrants and refugees are not the same thing. Immigrants are people who move to a new country voluntarily, while refugees are people who are forced to leave their own country due to war, persecution, or other reasons and are granted asylum in a new country. Canada has a long history of welcoming both immigrants and refugees, and it's important to keep that distinction clear.
