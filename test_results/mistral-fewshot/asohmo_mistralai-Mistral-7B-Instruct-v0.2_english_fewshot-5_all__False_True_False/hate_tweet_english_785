1. Americans want you to build the wall and fund it, but do they also want you to end chain migration, end the visa lottery, and pass E-Verify?2. If so, then it's not just about building the wall, it's about implementing a comprehensive immigration policy.3. It's important to address the root causes of illegal immigration, rather than just building a wall.4. Building a wall alone won't solve the problem, and it's a costly and ineffective solution.5. A more humane and effective approach would be to address the reasons why people are leaving their countries and coming to the US in the first place, such as poverty, violence, and lack of opportunities.6. The US has a responsibility to help address these issues, rather than simply building a wall and turning our backs on those in need.7. Additionally, there are legal and ethical considerations to take into account when it comes to immigration policy, such as respecting human rights and upholding the rule of law.Therefore, a more comprehensive and humane approach to immigration policy would be more effective and just in the long run.
