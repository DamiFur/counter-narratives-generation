"They" being who, exactly? Millions of whom? And what do you mean by "infiltrated"? Are we talking about criminals, or just people who are different from you?It's important to remember that everyone deserves respect and dignity, regardless of their background or nationality. Let's focus on building bridges, not walls.Instead of spreading hate and fear, let's work together to find solutions that benefit all members of our society. We can start by recognizing the common values and aspirations that unite us, rather than the differences that divide us.Let's promote understanding, empathy, and compassion, and work towards creating a more inclusive and welcoming society for everyone.#BuildBridgesNotWalls #NoToHateSpeech #EmbraceDiversity #WeAreAllHumanBeings #TreatEveryoneWithRespectAndDignity #LetUsWorkTogetherForABetterTomorrow #WeAreStrongerTogether #NoToFearMongering #NoToDiscrimination #NoToXenophobia #NoToRacism #NoToBigotry #NoToIntolerance #NoToPrejudice #NoToViolence #NoToHarassment #NoToBullying
