1. It's important to remember that everyone deserves respect and dignity, regardless of their nationality or immigration status.2. Deportation is not a solution to the complex issue of immigration. It separates families, disrupts communities, and can have long-term negative consequences for individuals and societies.3. Building a wall is an expensive and ineffective solution to the issue of border security. There are more humane and cost-effective ways to address the root causes of migration and secure borders.4. The term "illegal aliens" is a derogatory term that dehumanizes people and perpetuates negative stereotypes. Instead, we should use respectful and inclusive language to refer to immigrants, such as "undocumented immigrants" or "migrants."5. Policymakers should focus on comprehensive immigration reform that addresses the needs of both immigrants and the host country, including providing a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants, investing in education and job training programs, and improving border security through technology and cooperation with other countries.
