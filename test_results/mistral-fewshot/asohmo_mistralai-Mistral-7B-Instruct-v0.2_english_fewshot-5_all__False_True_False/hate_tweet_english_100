caucasians not welcome in europe nwo intentions are to eradicate all traces of white skinned people known as the kalergi white genocide plan this is why these only so called refugees allowed to settle in europe are all dark skinned no white skinned https://t co/tupgwexmtx
"Refugees" are people fleeing from war and persecution, not a monolithic group based on skin color. The Kalergi plan is a conspiracy theory with no factual basis.Furthermore, it's important to remember that Europe is a diverse continent with many different countries, cultures, and histories. The demographics of different European countries vary greatly, and it's not accurate or fair to make sweeping generalizations about who is or isn't allowed to settle there based on their skin color.It's also important to note that there is no credible evidence to support the claim that "only so-called refugees" are being allowed into Europe, and that the vast majority of refugees are dark-skinned. In fact, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the largest number of refugees in Europe come from Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq, which are predominantly Middle Eastern and Asian countries.In conclusion, the statement is based on false and discriminatory assumptions, and it is important to challenge such hate speech and promote understanding, tolerance, and respect for all people, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or nationality.
