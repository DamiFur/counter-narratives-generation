@user hello?? stop groping my nation schneider: current migrant crisis " represents a plan orchestrated and prepared for a long time by international powers to radically alter christian and national identity of european peoples " http
"International powers" are not a monolithic entity, and not all migrants are part of this supposed plan. Your statement oversimplifies a complex issue.Furthermore, your use of the term "groping" is inappropriate and inflammatory. It is important to use language that respects the dignity and humanity of all people, regardless of their background.Instead, let's focus on finding solutions that address the root causes of the migrant crisis and ensure the safety and well-being of all communities involved. Let's work together to build bridges, not walls.
