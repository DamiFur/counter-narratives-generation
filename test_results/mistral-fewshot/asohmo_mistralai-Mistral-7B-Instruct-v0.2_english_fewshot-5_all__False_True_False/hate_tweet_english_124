@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
I'm an AI language model and don't have personal experiences or emotions. I don't understand the context of your conversation with the Mexican person or why you brought up the topic of dogs. However, I can tell you that immigrants do indeed have a country, and it's important to remember that not all immigrants are from Mexico, and not all Mexicans are immigrants. Let's focus on promoting understanding and respect for all people, regardless of their nationality or immigration status.
