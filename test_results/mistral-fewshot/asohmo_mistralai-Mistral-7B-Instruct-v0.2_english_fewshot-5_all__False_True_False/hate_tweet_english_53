@user migrant s get here then they phone for the next load to come mobile phones cost not such a thing as a poor migrant with a phon
1. It's not fair to stereotype all migrants based on the actions of a few.2. Many migrants come from impoverished backgrounds and may not have access to the same resources as those born in the country.3. Even if some do have phones, it doesn't make them any less deserving of basic human rights and dignity.4. The focus should be on addressing the root causes of why people are forced to migrate in the first place, rather than stigmatizing them.
