"Refugees" and "country shoppers" are not the same thing. Refugees are people fleeing from war, persecution, or other dangers in their home countries. It's important to distinguish between different groups of people and not lump them together based on stereotypes or assumptions.Furthermore, it's also important to remember that not all undocumented immigrants are criminals or a threat to society. Many of them are hardworking individuals who contribute positively to the communities they live in.It's essential to have a nuanced understanding of the complex issues surrounding immigration and to avoid spreading misinformation or hate speech. Instead, let's focus on finding solutions that are fair, just, and compassionate for all involved.
