1. It's important to clarify that not all Africans are asking for money from the EU and not all of them are refugees.2. Suggesting concentration camps with no food or water is not a solution, it's a violation of human rights.3. Instead, we should focus on finding long-term, humane solutions to address the root causes of migration and provide support to those in need.4. Let's work together to build a world where everyone has access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities, regardless of where they come from.
