the hashtag americancommunists who live in our country want open borders hashtag draintheswamp hashtag stopthe invasion https://t co/vyuwzhiafp
"Drain the swamp" and "stop the invasion" are not mutually exclusive. It's possible to support draining the swamp while also opposing open borders.However, it's important to remember that not all people who support open borders identify as communists, and not all communists support open borders. Labeling an entire group based on a single issue is not fair or accurate.
