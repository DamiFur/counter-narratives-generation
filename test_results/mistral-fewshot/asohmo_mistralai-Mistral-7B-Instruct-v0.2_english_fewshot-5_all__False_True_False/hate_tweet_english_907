@user and this is exactly how it should be in england crime is low in slovakia etc but all the scumbags come to to commit crimes as they know they can get away with it - they never return hashtag stop immigration
"Scumbags" is a derogatory term. It's not fair to label an entire group of people based on the actions of a few.Also, it's important to remember that most immigrants are law-abiding citizens who contribute positively to society.Instead of focusing on fear and division, let's work towards creating policies that address the root causes of crime and ensure that everyone, regardless of their background, is held accountable for their actions.
