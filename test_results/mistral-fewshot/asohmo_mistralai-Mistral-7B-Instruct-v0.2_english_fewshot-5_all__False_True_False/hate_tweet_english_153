comparatively our own inner city youth & fellow americans live like 3rd class citizens while illegals are housed at ice centers that rival the best elementary schools & college dorms in the country hashtag buildthatwall @user @user @user @user @user
1. It's not fair to compare the living conditions of different groups without considering the reasons behind them.2. The living conditions of undocumented immigrants in ICE detention centers have been criticized for being inhumane and inadequate.3. Building a wall won't solve the root causes of poverty and lack of opportunities in inner cities.4. Instead of hating and blaming others, let's work together to improve the living conditions for all Americans, regardless of their immigration status.5. Let's invest in education, affordable housing, and job opportunities for inner city youth and other marginalized communities, rather than wasting resources on a divisive and ineffective policy like building a wall.
