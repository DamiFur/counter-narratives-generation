@user theres an agenda jprdan: white genocide is a crime eu funded report tells journalists not to write negative articles on migrant crisis "it even urges them to report colleagues to the authorities for hate speech crimes "https://t
1. The term "white genocide" is a far-right conspiracy theory and has no basis in fact.2. The EU report in question is aimed at combating hate speech and incitement to violence, not suppressing free speech.3. It's important to remember that freedom of speech includes the right to express unpopular or controversial opinions, but it also comes with responsibilities, such as not inciting violence or hate speech.4. The use of the term "genocide" in this context is not only inaccurate, but also inflammatory and divisive.5. Instead of focusing on fear and division, it would be more productive to address the root causes of the migrant crisis, such as poverty, conflict, and climate change, and work towards finding solutions that benefit all parties involved.
