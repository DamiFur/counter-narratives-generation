1. It's important to note that not all globalists want a borderless world or a one-world government.2. Even if some did, it's not clear how building a wall would stop them from achieving their supposed goal.3. The idea of "order out of chaos" is not exclusive to globalists, it can be found in various political ideologies.4. Building a wall is not a solution to the complex issue of global governance and international relations.5. The use of the term "globalist" as a derogatory term is often used to stoke fear and division, rather than promoting productive dialogue and understanding.
