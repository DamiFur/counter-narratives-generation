1. It's not fair to judge all immigrants based on the actions of a few.2. Many immigrants contribute to the economy and pay taxes.3. There are already programs in place to help those in need, regardless of their immigration status.4. Denying entry to those in need is not a solution to the issue of strained public assistance programs.5. A more comprehensive approach, such as addressing the root causes of poverty and inequality, would be more effective in the long run.
