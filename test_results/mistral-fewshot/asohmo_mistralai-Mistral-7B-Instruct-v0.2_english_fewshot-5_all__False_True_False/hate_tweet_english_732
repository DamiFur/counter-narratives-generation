"Building a wall" is not a solution to the complex issue of immigration. It is a simplistic and divisive approach that does not address the root causes of the problem.Instead, let's focus on comprehensive immigration reform that includes border security, a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and addressing the causes of migration from Central America.Let's work together to find a fair and just solution for all parties involved. #BuildBridgesNotWalls #ComprehensiveImmigrationReform #SolutionsNotHateSpeech
