1. It's important to remember that not all undocumented immigrants live in sanctuary cities and receive government aid.2. Building a wall or a dam won't solve the root causes of why people leave their countries and come to the US illegally.3. The US has a long history of accepting immigrants and should continue to do so in a humane and orderly manner.4. The cost of building a wall far outweighs the benefits, and there are more effective ways to address immigration and border security.5. The US should focus on comprehensive immigration reform that addresses the needs of both the economy and the communities affected by immigration.Instead of spreading hate and division, let's work together to find solutions that benefit everyone.
