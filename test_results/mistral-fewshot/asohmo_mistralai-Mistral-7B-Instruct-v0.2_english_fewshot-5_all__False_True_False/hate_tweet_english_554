1. Fact: There are 15 million illegal immigrants in the US and they give blue states extra congressional seats.2. Policy: Walk away from DACA, no amnesty, drain the deep state, and build the wall.It's important to remember that not all illegal immigrants are Democrats, and not all Democrats support giving them amnesty. It's a complex issue with many nuances that can't be fully captured in a tweet or a hashtag.Instead of focusing on hate and division, let's try to find common ground and work towards a solution that benefits everyone. We can start by acknowledging that there are valid concerns on both sides and working towards a comprehensive immigration reform that addresses the root causes of illegal immigration, ensures border security, and provides a pathway to legal status for those who are already here and contributing to our society.Let's also remember that immigrants, both legal and illegal, have made and continue to make significant contributions to our economy, our culture, and our communities. They are not just numbers or political pawns, they are human beings with hopes, dreams, and families. Let's treat them with the dignity and respect they deserve.
