learn from most of hashtag europe thats been hashtag invaded by mostly muslims then look at hashtag italy hashtag poland & others who elected politicians to hashtag stopim migration & hashtag deportillegals hashtag sweden & hashtag germany now trying to reverse the huge mistakes of unlimited migration of ppl who refuse to hashtag assimilate
"Invaded" is a strong and inaccurate term. People have the right to decide who they want to live with in their own country. It's important to remember that not all Muslims refuse to assimilate and that there are many peaceful and productive members of the Muslim community in Europe and around the world.Furthermore, it's essential to recognize that there are complex reasons why some people may not assimilate as quickly as others, and it's not just a matter of personal choice. Factors such as discrimination, lack of opportunities, and cultural differences can all play a role.It's also important to note that not all European countries have experienced the same level of migration, and the experiences of countries like Italy and Poland may not be directly comparable to those of countries like Sweden and Germany.Therefore, a more nuanced and informed approach is needed when discussing this issue, rather than resorting to hateful and divisive language.
