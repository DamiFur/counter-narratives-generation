@user families should not bring their kids into a country illegally would you? we cant afford them hashtag send them home
1. It's not about what we can afford, it's about human rights and compassion.2. Many of these families are fleeing from violence and poverty, they're not coming here for a free ride.3. Sending them home won't solve the problem, we need to address the root causes of why they're leaving their countries in the first place.4. And let's not forget that many of these families have children born in the US, who are US citizens by birthright. Deporting them would be a violation of their human rights.5. Instead, let's focus on finding a humane and just solution for these families, such as providing them with a path to legal status and integrating them into our society.6. We are a nation of immigrants, and it's our responsibility to welcome and help those in need, not to turn our backs on them.7. Let's remember that every human being deserves dignity, respect, and the opportunity to build a better future for themselves and their families.8. The world is a complex place, and there are no easy solutions to the challenges we face. But we can't let fear and hate dictate our actions. We need to come together as a community, as a nation,
