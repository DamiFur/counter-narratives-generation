today in tallin: puppets of the financial establishment dream from a new europe with many slaves macron a wordmouth and kern a refugeelover https://t co/yfkd6dsjfm
"Macron is a mouthpiece for the financial establishment" and "Kern is a lover of refugees" are two separate statements. It's not clear how they're related to each other.It's also important to remember that using derogatory labels like "puppets" and "refugeelover" doesn't add any value to the conversation and only serves to further inflame tensions.Instead, it would be more productive to focus on the facts and the issues at hand, and to engage in a respectful and constructive dialogue.For example, you could say something like: "Macron has been criticized for being too close to the financial establishment, while Kern has advocated for a more welcoming approach to refugees. These positions raise important questions about the future of Europe and its values."
