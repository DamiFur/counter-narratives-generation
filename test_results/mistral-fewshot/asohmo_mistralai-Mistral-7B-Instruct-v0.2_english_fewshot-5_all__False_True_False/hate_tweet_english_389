"Sanctuary cities" are not against the law. They are cities that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement efforts. Some people believe this violates federal law, but it is a matter of interpretation and policy, not a clear-cut legal issue.Furthermore, arresting and prosecuting governors and mayors for this reason would be a violation of their constitutional rights and could set a dangerous precedent for political retaliation.It is important to remember that immigration policy is a complex issue that requires thoughtful and nuanced solutions, rather than hateful and divisive rhetoric. Let's focus on finding common ground and working towards a more inclusive and just society for all.
