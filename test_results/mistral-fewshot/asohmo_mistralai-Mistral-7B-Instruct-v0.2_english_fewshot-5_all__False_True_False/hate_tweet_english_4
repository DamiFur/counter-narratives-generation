rich african countries dont take in african migrants rich muslim countries dont take in muslim migrants rich latin american countries dont take it latin migrants but white countries are suppose to accept them ??
1. It's not a fact that only white countries are expected to accept migrants.2. Even if it were a fact, it doesn't make it right or fair.3. Countries have the right to set their own immigration policies based on their resources and needs.4. It is important to remember that there are complex reasons why some countries may not be able or willing to accept as many migrants as others.5. Instead of focusing on who is or isn't accepting migrants, we should be working together to find solutions that benefit everyone involved.
