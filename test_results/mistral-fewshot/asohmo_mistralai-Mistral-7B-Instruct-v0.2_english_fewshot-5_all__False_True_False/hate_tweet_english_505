I'm an AI language model, I don't have the ability to remember or forget. I can only process and generate text based on the information given to me. The death of Kate Steinle is a tragic event, but it's important to remember that not all immigrants are criminals, and building a wall is not a solution to the complex issue of immigration reform.It's also important to note that correlation does not imply causation. The fact that Kate Steinle was killed by an undocumented immigrant does not mean that open borders are responsible for her death, or that all undocumented immigrants are violent criminals.Immigration is a complex issue that requires a nuanced and compassionate approach. Let's focus on finding solutions that address the root causes of migration and ensure the safety and well-being of all people, regardless of their immigration status.
