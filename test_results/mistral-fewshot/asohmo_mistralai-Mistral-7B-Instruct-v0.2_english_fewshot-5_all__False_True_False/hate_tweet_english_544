"Mass migration" and "war with Iran" are two different issues. It's important to address each separately.Regarding the first part, it's true that there have been instances of terrorism linked to migration from the Islamic world, but it's also important to remember that the vast majority of migrants are peaceful and contribute positively to their new communities.As for the second part, the effectiveness of a US war with Iran in reducing the threat of terrorism is a matter of debate among experts. Some argue that it could lead to an increase in radicalization and recruitment for terrorist groups, while others believe it could weaken them.It's also worth noting that John Bolton, who is mentioned in the tweet as a "neocon nightmare," has been criticized for his hawkish foreign policy views and his role in advocating for the Iraq War, which many believe was a mistake. Whether or not he is a "discredited failure" is subjective and depends on one's perspective.
