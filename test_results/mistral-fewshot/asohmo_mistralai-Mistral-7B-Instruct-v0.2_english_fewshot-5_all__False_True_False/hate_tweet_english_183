"Walkaway from lies" doesn't necessarily mean they're against building a wall or immigration reform. It's important to understand the nuances of the issue and not oversimplify it.Additionally, it's worth noting that not all Democrats hold the same views on immigration policy. There is a wide range of opinions within the party, and it's not accurate to label all Democrats as "corrupt" or against the interests of hard-working Americans.It's also important to remember that building a wall and ending chain migration, visa lottery, and amnesty are not mutually exclusive. It is possible to have a comprehensive immigration reform that addresses border security, merit-based immigration, and a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.Therefore, instead of demonizing one side or the other, it would be more productive to engage in a constructive and respectful dialogue to find a bipartisan solution that benefits the country as a whole.
