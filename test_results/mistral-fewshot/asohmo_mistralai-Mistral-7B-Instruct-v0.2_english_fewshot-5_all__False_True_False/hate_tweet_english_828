"@user a special team of 100 people be made under a most respected rtd judge let them visit each indian state camp there &amp identify all the illegal migrants &amp people with expired visas govt then must ensure immediate deportation for the"
1. It's important to note that not all migrants are illegal, and many have valid visas that have simply expired.2. Creating a special team to identify and deport people may lead to human rights abuses and violations of due process.3. Deportation is a costly and complex process that requires significant resources and coordination between governments.4. A more effective and humane approach would be to provide a pathway to legal status for those who have been living in the country for a certain period of time and have contributed to society.5. It is also important to address the root causes of migration, such as poverty, violence, and lack of opportunities in the countries of origin.Instead of focusing on punishment and deportation, let's work towards a more inclusive and welcoming society that values the contributions of all people, regardless of their immigration status.
