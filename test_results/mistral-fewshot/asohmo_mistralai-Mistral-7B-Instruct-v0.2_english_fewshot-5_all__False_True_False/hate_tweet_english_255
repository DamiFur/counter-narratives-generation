1. It's important to note that not all Hispanics support anti-immigration policies, and not all Democrats support pro-illegal immigration policies.2. The impact of illegal immigration on wages, jobs, and communities is a complex issue, and it's not accurate to say that it only affects Hispanics and African Americans.3. The term "socialist" is often used as a derogatory term, and it doesn't accurately describe the policies of the Democratic Party.4. Walking away from a political party doesn't solve the problem, it just leaves people without a voice in the political process.5. A more productive approach would be to engage in constructive dialogue and work towards finding solutions that benefit everyone involved.
