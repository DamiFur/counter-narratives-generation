and now it's time for the government to take responsibility and find a fair and just solution for all parties involved.Instead of pointing fingers and spreading hate, let's work together to find a long-term, sustainable solution to this complex issue.It's important to remember that every person, regardless of their immigration status, is a human being deserving of dignity and respect. Let's focus on the common ground and find a way forward that benefits everyone. #compassion #solutionfocused #immigrationreform
