Sudacas or moros? (fact or opinion?)Justification: In Mierditerráneo digital, people are a bit obsessed with reporting fictitious violations. (fact)Conclusion: Denouncing that a GC and a military man violated a 18-year-old girl is not very patriotic for gays and a Marroquí. Are they gay black Sudacans or Moros? (Fact or Opinion?)Answer:The first part of the statement is a fact. People in Mierditteráneo digital are indeed obessed with reporting fake violations.However, the second part is an opinion. There is no factual basis for the statement that denouncing a violation by a GC and military man is not patriotic for gay Marroquís, or that they are more likely to be gay, black, Sudacans, or Moros. This is a baseless stereotype and an attempt to stigmatize and marginalize certain groups based on their identity.Therefore, the conclusion is an opinion and not a fact. It is important to avoid spreading such stereotypes and instead promote respect, understanding, and equality for all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or nationality.
