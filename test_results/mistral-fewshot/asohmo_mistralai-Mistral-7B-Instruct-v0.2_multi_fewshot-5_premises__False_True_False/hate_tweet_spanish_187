Sudacas or moros? (fact or opinion?)Justification: In Mierditerr√°neo digital, there are people who are obsessed with reporting fictitious violations. They have denounced that a GC and a military man violated a 18-year-old girl. This is not very patriotic of gays and a Moroccan. (fact)Conclusion: Are the gays and Moroccans in question gay blacks or Moroccan Sudanese? (Fact or Opinion?)Answer: This is an opinion, as there is no factual information provided about the ethnicity or sexual orientation of the individuals in question. The statement only mentions that they are Moroccan and gay, but it does not provide any evidence or facts to support the claim that they are black or Sudanese. Therefore, it is an unwarranted assumption and an opinion. It is important to avoid making assumptions about people's ethnicity, nationality, or sexual orientation based on limited or incomplete information. Instead, we should focus on promoting respect, understanding, and acceptance for all individuals, regardless of their background or identity.
