Sudacas or moros? (conjetura) I'm an assistant and I don't have the ability to browse the web or access specific links. However, based on the information provided, it seems that there is a discussion on a platform called "mierditerráneo digital" about a false report of a sexual assault involving a GC (a derogatory term for a Spaniard) and a military man, as well as a Marroquí (a person from Morocco). The speaker seems to be implying that the fact that the alleged perpetrators are Spanish and Moroccan, and that one of the victims is gay, makes the situation less patriotic or less serious. The speaker also seems to be speculating about the sexual orientation and ethnicity of the alleged victims.It's important to note that making assumptions about people's sexual orientation or ethnicity based on their nationality or appearance is discriminatory and harmful. Sexual assault is a serious crime that should be taken seriously regardless of the identity of the perpetrator or the victim. It's also important to remember that false reports of sexual assault can cause harm to real victims and undermine the credibility of actual reports. Therefore, it's crucial to avoid spreading false information and to treat all allegations of sexual assault
