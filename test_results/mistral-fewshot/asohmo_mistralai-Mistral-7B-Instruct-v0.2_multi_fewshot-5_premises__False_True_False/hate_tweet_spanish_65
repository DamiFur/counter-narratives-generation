Sudacas or moros? (fact, but irrelevant)Response:It's disheartening to see such baseless and harmful allegations being spread online. The accusation that a GC and a military personnel violated an 18-year-old's rights is a serious matter that should be handled with care and respect for the truth. It's important to remember that everyone is entitled to the presumption of innocence until proven guilty in a court of law.As for the irrelevant statement about gays, blacks, Sudacas, and Moros, it's crucial to reject any attempts to stoke division and hatred based on unfounded stereotypes or assumptions. Let's focus on promoting understanding, respect, and equality for all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic.Instead of fueling the obsession with fictitious violations, let's work together to create a safer and more inclusive digital community where everyone can express themselves freely and without fear of discrimination or harassment.
