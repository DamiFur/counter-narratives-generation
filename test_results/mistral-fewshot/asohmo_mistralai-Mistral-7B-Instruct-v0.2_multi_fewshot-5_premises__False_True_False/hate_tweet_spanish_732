Sudacas or moros? (fact, but not directly related to the original claim) Response:It's important to clarify that the original claim made in the tweet is false. There is no evidence to support the allegation that a GC and a military member violated an 18-year-old's rights, let alone that they are gay, Marroqui, or Sudacan or Moroccan.Regarding the second part of the question, it's crucial to note that being gay, Sudacan, Moroccan, or any other ethnicity or sexual orientation does not make someone more or less likely to commit a violent act. Stereotyping and making assumptions based on someone's identity is not only inaccurate but also harmful and discriminatory.Furthermore, the obsession with fictitious violations on Mierditerr√°neo digital is a matter of concern, as it can contribute to the spread of misinformation and hate speech. It's essential to promote accurate information, respect for human rights, and peaceful dialogue to counteract such harmful narratives.
