comparatively our own inner city youth & fellow americans live like 3rd class citizens while illegals are housed at ice centers that rival the best elementary schools & college dorms in the country hashtag buildthatwall @user @user @user @user @user
Sudacas or moros? (fact, speculation) Response:It's important to clarify that the information in the tweet is not factual. There is no evidence to support the claim that a GC and a military member violated an 18-year-old's rights, nor is there any factual basis for the assumption that the individual in question is a gay Marroqui. The obsession with fictitious violations in Mierditerr√°neo Digital is a matter of concern, but it's crucial not to jump to conclusions or make assumptions based on unfounded allegations. Let's focus on promoting accurate information and respect for all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or nationality.
