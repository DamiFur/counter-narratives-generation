Sudacas or moros? (fact, but irrelevant)Response:It's disheartening to see such hateful and baseless claims being spread online. The allegations of a GC and a military personnel violating a 18-year-old, along with the mention of a Marroqu√≠ being gay and Sudacan or Moroccan, are not only factually unproven but also offensive and discriminatory. It's important to remember that everyone deserves respect and dignity, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. Let's focus on promoting understanding, empathy, and peace in our digital communities. #EndHateSpeech #PromoteLoveNotHate #RespectDiversity.
