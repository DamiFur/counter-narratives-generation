Sudacas or moros? (fact or opinion?)Justification: In Mierditerráneo digital, they are a bit obsessed with reporting fictitious violations. (fact)Conclusion: Denouncing that a GC and a military man violated a 18-year-old girl is not very patriotic for gays and a Marroquí. Are they gay black Sudacans or Moros? (Fact or Opinion?)Answer:The first part of the statement is a fact, as reported by the speaker. However, the second part is an opinion. There is no factual basis to support the claim that being gay, black, Sudacan, or Moroccan makes someone less patriotic, or that there is a correlation between these identities and the denunciation of violations. Additionally, there is no evidence presented to suggest that the individuals in question are, in fact, gay or of Sudanese, Moroccan, or any other national or ethnic background. Therefore, the conclusion is an opinion, not a fact.
