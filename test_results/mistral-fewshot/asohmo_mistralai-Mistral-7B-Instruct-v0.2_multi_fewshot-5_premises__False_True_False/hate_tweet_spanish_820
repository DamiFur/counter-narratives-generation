Sudacas or moros? (conjetura) It is a fact that in Mierditerráneo Digital, people are obsessed with reporting fictitious violations. It is also a fact that they denounced that a GC and a military man violated a 18-year-old girl. However, it is a conjecture that the Marroquí in question is a gay black Sudacan or Moroccan. My response:It's disheartening to see such baseless and inflammatory claims being spread online. The fact that someone has reported a fictitious violation is concerning enough, but to then make assumptions about someone's identity based on their nationality and sexual orientation is not only wrong but also harmful. Let's focus on promoting truth and respect for all individuals, regardless of their background or personal characteristics.
