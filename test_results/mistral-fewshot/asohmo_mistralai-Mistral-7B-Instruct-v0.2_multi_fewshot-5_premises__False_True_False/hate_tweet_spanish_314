Sudacas or moros? (fact, but irrelevant)Response:It's disheartening to see such baseless and harmful accusations being spread on Mierditerr√°neo digital. The claim that a GC and a military personnel violated a 18-year-old child, and the subsequent insinuation about their ethnicity and sexual orientation, is not only factually unproven but also deeply discriminatory and unpatriotic. Let's focus on promoting truth, understanding, and respect for all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. #EndHateSpeech #PromoteLoveNotHate #RespectDiversity.
