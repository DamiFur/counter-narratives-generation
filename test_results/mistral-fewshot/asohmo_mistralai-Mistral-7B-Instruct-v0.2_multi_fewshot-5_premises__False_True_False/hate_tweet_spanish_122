Sudacas or moros? (fact, but not directly related to the initial claim) Response:It's important to clarify that the initial claim made in the tweet is that "los pro vida" (pro-lifers) are complaining that Europe, the United States, Canada, and a large part of Asia are "asesinos" (killers) and should close their borders, and that "solo nosotras" (we) cannot have rights because we are "sudacas" (Southern Europeans). The justification given is that "en mierditerráneo digital" (on Mierditterráneo Digital, a social media platform) people are "obsesionados" (obsessed) with reporting fictitious violations, and the conclusion drawn is that a GC (military man) and a Marroquí (Moroccan) were accused of raping a 18-year-old girl, and they are "gays negros" (black gays).However, the initial claim and the conclusion are not directly related. The initial claim is about immigration and border control, while the conclusion is about the ethnicity and sexual orientation of two individuals accused of a crime. It's crucial to separate the two issues and address them
