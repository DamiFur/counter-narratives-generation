Sudacas or moros? (fact, but not directly related to the original claim)It seems that in Mierditteráneo Digital, there is an obsession with reporting fictitious violations. A claim was made that a GC and a military man violated a 18-year-old girl. This is not very patriotic of gays and a Marroquí. They might be gay, black, Sudacas, or Moros.Justification:* The statement "en mierditerráneo digital" indicates that the context is a specific online community.* The term "obsesionados" implies an excessive preoccupation or fixation.* "Las violaciones" refers to reports or allegations of sexual violence.* It is stated that these reports are "ficticias," implying that they are false or fabricated.Conclusion:The claim that "gays, negros, sudacas, o moros" are involved in the false reports of sexual violence is not directly stated in the text, but it is implied by the mention of "gays" and "Marroquí" in the same sentence as the reference to the false reports. However, it is important to note that this conclusion is not directly related
