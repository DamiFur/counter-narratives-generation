Sudacas or moros? (fact or opinion?)Justification: In MierdaTerritorial digital, they are a bit obsessed with reporting fictitious violations. (fact)Conclusion: Denouncing that a GC and a military man violated a 18-year-old girl is not very patriotic for gays and a Marroquí. Are they gay black Sudanese or Moros?
