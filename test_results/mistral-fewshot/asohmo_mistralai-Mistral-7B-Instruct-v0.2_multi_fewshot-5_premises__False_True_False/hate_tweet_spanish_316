Sudacas or moros? (conjetura) It is a fact that in Mierditteráneo Digital, there are people who are obsessed with reporting fictitious violations. It is also a fact that they recently denounced that a GC and a military man violated a 18-year-old girl. However, it is a conjecture that this denunciation is not very patriotic towards gays and that the Marroquí in question is a gay black Sudacan or Moroccan. My response:It's disheartening to see how some individuals on Mierditerráneo Digital spend an inordinate amount of time reporting fake violations. In the latest instance, they claimed that a GC (General Coordinator) and a military personnel had violated the rights of an 18 year old girl. It's important to remember that these allegations are unproven and should be taken with a grain of salt. As for the second part of your question, there's no evidence to suggest that the individual in question is gay, black, Sudacan, or Morrocan. Let's focus on facts and avoid making assumptions based on stereotypes or prejudices.
