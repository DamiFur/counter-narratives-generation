Sudacas or moros? (fact, but irrelevant)Response:It's disheartening to see such baseless and harmful accusations being spread online. The fact is that there is no truth to the claim that a GC and a military personnel violated an 18-year-old child. Such allegations are not only damaging to the individuals involved but also contribute to a toxic and divisive online environment. It's important to remember that everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. Let's focus on promoting positive and inclusive messages instead. #EndHateSpeech #PromoteLoveNotHate #RespectDiversity.
