Sudacas or moros? (fact, but irrelevant)Response:It's important to address the root cause of the obsession with fictitious violations on Mierditerr√°neo Digital. This behavior is not conducive to healthy online discourse and can be harmful to individuals and communities. Instead of focusing on unfounded accusations, it's crucial to promote respect, understanding, and factual information.Regarding the irrelevant statement about gays, blacks, Sudacas, and Moros, it is essential to clarify that being gay, black, Sudacan, or Moroccan does not make someone more or less likely to commit a violent act or be a victim of one. It is important to remember that individuals come in all shapes, sizes, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, and backgrounds, and their actions should be judged based on their own merits, not on preconceived notions or stereotypes.Therefore, the focus should be on promoting a safe and inclusive online environment where everyone can express themselves freely and respectfully, without fear of harassment or discrimination based on their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or any other personal characteristic.
