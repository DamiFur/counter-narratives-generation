Sudacas or moros? (conjetura) Respuesta:It's important to clarify that the information in the tweet is not factual. There is no evidence to support the claim that a GC and a military member violated an 18-year-old's rights or that a Marroquí is a gay black Sudacan or Moroccan.Regarding the first part of the tweet, it's concerning that there are individuals who are obsessed with reporting fictitious violations on Mierditerráneo digital. This kind of behavior not only spreads misinformation but also contributes to a toxic online environment. It's essential to promote truth and accuracy in all forms of communication.As for the second part, there is no correlation between being gay, black, Sudacan, Moroccan, or any other ethnicity or sexual orientation and being a violator. People come from all walks of life, and it's not fair or accurate to stereotype or make assumptions based on someone's identity. Let's focus on promoting respect, understanding, and equality for all.
