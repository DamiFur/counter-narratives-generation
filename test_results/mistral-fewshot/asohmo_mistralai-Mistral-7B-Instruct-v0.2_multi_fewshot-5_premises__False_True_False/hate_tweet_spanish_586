Sudacas or moros? (fact or opinion?)Justification: In MierdaTerritorial digital, they are a bit obsessed with reporting fictitious violations. (fact)Conclusion: Denouncing that a GC and a military man violated a 18-year-old girl is not very patriotic for gays and a Moroccan. Are they gay black Sudacans or Moroccans? (Fact or Opinion?)Answer:The first part of the statement is a fact, as reported by the text. However, the second part is an opinion, as there is no factual basis to support the claim that the patriotism of gays and Moroccans is affected by this denunciation, or that the individuals in question are gay, black, Sudacan, or Moroccan for that matter. The text does not provide any information on their identities beyond the fact that one is a GC and the other a military man. Therefore, the conclusion is not based on facts, but rather on assumptions and stereotypes.
