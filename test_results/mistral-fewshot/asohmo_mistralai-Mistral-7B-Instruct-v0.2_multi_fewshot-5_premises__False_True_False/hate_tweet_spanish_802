@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
Sudacas or moros? (conjetura) It's important to clarify that I'm an AI language model and don't have the ability to browse the web or access specific tweets, including the one you've linked. I can only respond based on the text you've provided.Regarding your justification, it's a fact that there are individuals on Mierditerráneo Digital who are obsessed with reporting fictitious violations. Your conclusion, however, is a conjecture. There's no evidence provided in the text to suggest that the individuals in question are gay, Marroquí, Sudacas, or Moros. It's crucial to avoid making assumptions based on stereotypes or prejudices. Instead, let's focus on combating hate speech and promoting understanding and respect for all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic.
