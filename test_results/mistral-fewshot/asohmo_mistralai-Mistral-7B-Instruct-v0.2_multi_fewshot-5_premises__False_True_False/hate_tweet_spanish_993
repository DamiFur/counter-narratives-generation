Sudacas or moros? (fact, but irrelevant)It seems that in MierdaTerritorial digital, there are people who are obsessed with reporting fictitious rapes. They reported that a GC and a soldier raped a 18-year-old girl. This is not very patriotic of gays and a Moroccan. (They are gays and Moroccans, but it's irrelevant to the issue)Justification:* In MierdataTerritory digital, there is a group of individuals who are excessively preoccupied with reporting fake rapes. (Fact)* They reported an incident of an alleged rape committed by a GC (Gendarmerie Corps member) and a soldier. (Fact, but the allegations are unproven)Conclusion:The fact that these individuals are gay and Moroccan is not relevant to the issue at hand, which is the obsession with reporting false rape allegations. Therefore, it is important to focus on addressing the root cause of this issue rather than making irrelevant assumptions based on the identities of those involved.
