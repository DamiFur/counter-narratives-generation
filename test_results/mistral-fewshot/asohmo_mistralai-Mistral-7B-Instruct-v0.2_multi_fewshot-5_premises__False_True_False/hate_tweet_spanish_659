Sudacas or moros? (conjetura) There seems to be a misunderstanding here. Let me clarify:Justification: In Mierditerráneo Digital, there are people who are obsessed with reporting fictitious violations. (Fact)Conclusion: The denunciation that a GC and a military man violated a 18-year-old girl is not very patriotic, and the Marroquí in question may or may not be a gay black Sudacan or Moroccan. (Conjecture)There is no factual basis for the assumption that the individuals involved in the reported violation are gay, black, Sudacan, or Morrocan. The focus should be on addressing the issue of fictitious reports of violations, rather than making assumptions or stereotypes based on race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation.
