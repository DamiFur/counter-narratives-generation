Sudacas or moros? (conjetura) It is a fact that in MierdaTerritorial digital, people are obsessed with reporting fictitious violations. It is also a fact that they denounced that a GC and a military man violated a 18-year-old girl. However, it is a conjecture that the Marroqui in question is a gay black Sudacan or Moroccan. My response:It's important to clarify that making assumptions about someone's identity based on their nationality, race, or sexual orientation is not only inaccurate but also harmful and disrespectful. The focus should be on addressing the reported violation and holding the perpetrators accountable, regardless of their background or personal characteristics.
