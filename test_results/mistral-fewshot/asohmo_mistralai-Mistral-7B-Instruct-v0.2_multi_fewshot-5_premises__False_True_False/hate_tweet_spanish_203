Sudacas or moros? (fact, speculation) This tweet appears to be reporting on a conversation that took place on the platform "mierditerráneo digital," where individuals were discussing a fictional allegation of a sexual assault involving a GC (presumably a Catalan separatist) and a military member, as well as a Marroquí (Moroccan) individual. The tweet expresses skepticism about the patriotism of the individuals involved, and speculates about their potential identities as gay, black, and/or Sudacas (a derogatory term for Spaniards of African descent). The justification for the tweet is that there is an obsession with fictional violations on the platform, and the conclusion is a question about the potential identities of those involved in the conversation. However, it's important to note that the tweet itself does not provide any evidence or facts to support the speculation about the individuals' identities or sexual orientation, and it perpetuates harmful stereotypes and discrimination.
