Sudacas or moros? (fact, but not directly related to the original claim) Response:It's important to clarify that the original claim in the tweet does not make any reference to the race or ethnicity of the alleged perpetrators or the victim. The claim only mentions that the perpetrators are a GC (a term that can refer to various groups, including military or government officials) and a military person.Regarding the second part of the question, there is no factual basis for assuming that the individuals in question are Moroccan or Sudacan, or that they are gay or black. These are unrelated speculations that do not add any value to the discussion of the original claim.Counter-narrative:Let's focus on the facts and avoid making assumptions based on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or any other irrelevant factor. The original claim alleges that there have been fictitious denunciations of a violation of an 18-year-old girl. It's essential to investigate and verify the accuracy of these claims before jumping to conclusions or making assumptions about the individuals involved. Let's promote a culture of fact-checking and evidence-based discourse to counteract the spread of misinformation and hate speech.
