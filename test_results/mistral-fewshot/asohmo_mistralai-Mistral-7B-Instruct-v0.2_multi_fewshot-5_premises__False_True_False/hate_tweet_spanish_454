Sudacas or moros? (fact, but irrelevant)Response:It's disheartening to see such baseless and offensive claims being spread online. The allegations of a GC and a military personnel sexually assaulting a 18-year-old, along with the mention of a Marroqui being gay and Sudacan or Moroccan, are not only factually unproven but also harmful and discriminatory. It's important to remember that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation, have the right to live free from violence and discrimination. Let's focus on promoting respect, understanding, and equality for all. #EndHateSpeech #PromoteLoveNotHate #RespectDiversity.
