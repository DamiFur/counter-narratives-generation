Sudacas or moros? (fact or opinion?)Justification: In Mierditerr√°neo digital, people are a bit obsessed with reporting fictitious violations. They denounced that a GC and a military man violated a 18-year-old girl. This is not very patriotic of gays and a Moroccan. (fact)Conclusion: Are gays and Moroccans going to be gay black Sudacans or Moros? (Fact or Opinion?)Answer: This is an opinion, as there is no factual basis for the assumption that all gays are black or that all Moroccans are Moros or Sudacans. The original statement is a fact, but the conclusion drawn from it is an unwarranted generalization and an expression of prejudice. It's important to remember that individuals cannot be defined by their race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation alone, and that everyone deserves respect and dignity as unique individuals.
