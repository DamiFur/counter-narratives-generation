Sudacas or moros? (conjetura) It is a fact that in MierdaTerritorial digital, there are people who are obsessed with reporting fictitious violations. It is also a fact that they recently denounced that a GC and a soldier violated a 18-year-old girl. However, it is a conjecture that this denunciation is not very patriotic towards gays and that the Marroqui in question is a gay black Sudacan or Moro. My response:It's important to clarify that the information provided is based on facts and conjectures. While it's true that there are individuals in Mierdaterritorial Digital who report fictitious violence, it's also true that a denunciation was made regarding a GC and soldier allegedly violating a young girl. Regarding the conjecture, there's no evidence to support the claim that the individual in question is gay, black, Sudacan, or Moroccan. It's crucial to avoid jumping to conclusions and spreading unfounded rumors or stereotypes. Let's focus on the facts and leave the speculation behind.
