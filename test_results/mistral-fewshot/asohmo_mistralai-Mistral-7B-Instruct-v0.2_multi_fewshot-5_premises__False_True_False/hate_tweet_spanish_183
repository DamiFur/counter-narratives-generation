Sudacas or moros? (fact, but irrelevant)Response:It's important to clarify that the information provided in the tweet is not factual, as there is no evidence to support the claim that a GC and a military member violated an 18-year-old's rights in MierdaTerráneo Digital. Furthermore, there is no factual basis for the assumption that the Marroquí in question is a gay, black, or Sudacan or Moroccan individual. It's crucial to avoid spreading unfounded rumors and to respect people's privacy and dignity. Instead, let's focus on promoting respect, understanding, and equality for all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic.
