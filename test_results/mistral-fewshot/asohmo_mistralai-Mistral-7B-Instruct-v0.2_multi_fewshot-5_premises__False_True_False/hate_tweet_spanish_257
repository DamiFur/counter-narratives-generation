Sudacas or moros? (fact, but irrelevant to the argument)Response:It's important to clarify that the information provided in the tweet is not factual. There is no evidence to support the claim that a GC and a military member violated an 18-year-old's rights or that a Marroqui is gay and Sudacan or Moroccan. Furthermore, it's essential to recognize that there is no link between being gay, black, or Sudacan/Moroccan and being a perpetrator of violence or a violator of rights. It's crucial to promote understanding, respect, and equality for all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or nationality. Let's focus on fostering a positive and inclusive online community instead of spreading misinformation and hate speech.
