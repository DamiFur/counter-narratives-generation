Sudacas or moros? (fact, but irrelevant)It's important to address the underlying hate speech in this tweet. The tweet implies that there's something inherently unpatriotic about being gay and being from a certain region or ethnicity. This is a harmful stereotype and a form of discrimination.Counter-narrative: All individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, ethnicity, or nationality, have the right to be proud of their identity and their country. The actions of a few should not be used to stereotype and discriminate against entire groups of people. Let's focus on promoting love, acceptance, and respect for all. #EndHateSpeech #LoveIsLove #AcceptanceForAll #HumanRightsForAll #NoToDiscrimination.
