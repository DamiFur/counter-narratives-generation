Sudacas or moros? (fact, but irrelevant) Response:It's disheartening to see such baseless and harmful accusations being spread on Mierditerr√°neo digital. The allegations of a GC and a military personnel violating a 18-year-old child, along with insinuations about their ethnicity and sexuality, are not only factually unproven but also deeply offensive and discriminatory.

Let's focus on promoting understanding, compassion, and truth in our online discourse.
