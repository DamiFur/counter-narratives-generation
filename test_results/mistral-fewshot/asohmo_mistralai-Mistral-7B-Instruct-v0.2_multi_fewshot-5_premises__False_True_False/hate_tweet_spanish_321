Sudacas or moros? (fact or opinion?)Justification: In MierdaTerritorial digital, they are a bit obsessed with reporting fictitious violations. (fact)Conclusion: Denouncing that a GC and a military man violated a 18-year-old girl is not very patriotic for gays and a Moroccan. Are they gay black Sudacans or Moroccans? (Fact or Opinion?)Answer:The first part of the statement is a fact. The second part is an opinion, as there is no evidence provided to support the claim that being gay or Moroccan makes someone less patriotic, or that the individuals in question are black or Sudacan. The statement also makes an assumption about the identities and nationalities of the individuals involved in the alleged violation, which is not based on factual information. Therefore, the conclusion is not a fact, but rather an opinion or speculation.
