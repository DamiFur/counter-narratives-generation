Sudacas or moros? (fact or opinion?)Justification: In Mierditerráneo digital, people are a bit obsessed with reporting fictitious violations. (fact)Conclusion: Denouncing that a GC and a military man violated a 18-year-old girl is not very patriotic for gays and a Marroquí. Are they gay black Sudacans or Moros? (Fact or Opinion?)Answer:The first part of the statement is a fact, as reported by the speaker. However, the second part is an opinion, as there is no factual evidence to support the claim that denouncing a violent act is not patriotic for a specific group of people, or that the individuals in question are gay, black, Sudacan, or Moroccan. The speaker is making an assumption based on their own perspective and biases.
