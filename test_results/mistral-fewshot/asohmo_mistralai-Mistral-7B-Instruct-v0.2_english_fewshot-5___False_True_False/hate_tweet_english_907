@user and this is exactly how it should be in england crime is low in slovakia etc but all the scumbags come to to commit crimes as they know they can get away with it - they never return hashtag stop immigration
1. It's important to remember that not all immigrants commit crimes, and not all crimes are committed by immigrants.2. Criminal behavior is not exclusive to any particular nationality or ethnicity.3. It is not fair to stereotype or stigmatize an entire group based on the actions of a few.4. Immigration policies should be based on facts and evidence, not fear or prejudice.5. It is essential to focus on addressing the root causes of crime, rather than scapegoating a particular group.6. We should strive to create a welcoming and inclusive society where everyone feels safe and valued, regardless of their nationality or immigration status.
