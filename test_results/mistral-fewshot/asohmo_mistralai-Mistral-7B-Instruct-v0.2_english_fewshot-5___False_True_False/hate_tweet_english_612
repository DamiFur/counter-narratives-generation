@user @user @user @user a very high wall must be build to protect usa from bad elements of illigal refugees
1. It's important to remember that not all immigrants are "bad elements." Many contribute positively to society.2. Building a wall won't solve the root causes of the issue, such as poverty, violence, and instability in their home countries.3. The cost of building and maintaining a wall is extremely high and could be better spent on education, healthcare, and other essential services.4. The U.S. has a long history of welcoming immigrants and should continue to do so in a fair and just manner.
