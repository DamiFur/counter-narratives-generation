@user who care for these children of criminal refugees really they play no role in times of overpopulation
1. It's important to remember that not all refugees are criminals.2. Children are not responsible for the actions of their parents.3. Overpopulation is a complex issue that cannot be solved by discriminating against certain groups of people.4. Providing education and opportunities to children, regardless of their background, is a long-term investment in a better future for everyone.
