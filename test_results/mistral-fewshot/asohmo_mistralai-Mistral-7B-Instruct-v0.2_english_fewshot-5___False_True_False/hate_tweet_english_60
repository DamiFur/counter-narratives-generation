@user for god sake dont put india to danger by unchecked appeasement of ur special community illegal migrants nation is supreme
"Special community" and "illegal migrants" are not interchangeable terms. It's important to differentiate between individuals and groups based on their actions, not their ethnicity or nationality.Furthermore, "appeasement" is not a solution to the issue of illegal immigration. A more effective approach would be to address the root causes of why people are leaving their home countries and to work towards finding a fair and just solution for those who have already immigrated illegally.It's also important to remember that immigrants, regardless of their legal status, contribute to the economy and society in many ways. They are not a monolithic group and should not be stereotyped or stigmatized based on the actions of a few.Lastly, it's crucial to respect the rule of law and uphold the values of equality and justice for all, regardless of nationality or immigration status.
