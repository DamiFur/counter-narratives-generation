1. It's important to remember that everyone has the right to their own opinion, even if it's different from yours.2. Comparing someone to Carrot Top, a comedian known for his unconventional appearance, and implying that they would be "decimated" in a debate, is disrespectful and unprofessional.3. The use of multiple hashtags in a single tweet can make it difficult for readers to follow the main point of the message.4. The statement about DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) is a complex issue, and it's not as simple as "rewarding" people for breaking the law.5. The statement "USA" at the end of the tweet is unclear, it could be referring to the United States of America, or it could be a typo for something else.6. The tweet contains a lot of strong language, which can be off-putting to some readers and may not be effective in changing anyone's mind.Instead, try to focus on the facts and the issues at hand, and present your arguments in a respectful and clear manner. This will be more likely to engage and persuade others, rather than alienating them with inflammatory language and personal attacks
