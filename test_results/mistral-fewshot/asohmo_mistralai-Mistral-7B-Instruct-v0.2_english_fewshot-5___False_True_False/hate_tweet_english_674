1. Unchecked population growth and migration are indeed challenges for many countries, including India.2. However, punishing large families by withdrawing support is not an effective solution.3. Instead, promoting education, economic opportunities, and access to family planning resources can help address the root causes of population growth.4. Additionally, addressing the reasons why people migrate, such as poverty and lack of opportunities, can help reduce the need for migration.5. It's important to remember that every individual deserves dignity and support, regardless of their family size or migration status.
