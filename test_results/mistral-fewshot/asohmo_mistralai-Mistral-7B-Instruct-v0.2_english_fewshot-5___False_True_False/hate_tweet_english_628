canada is an immigrant country dont change it to refugee country please
Immigrants and refugees are not mutually exclusive. Canada has a long history of welcoming both immigrants and refugees.Immigrants are people who come to a country to live and work permanently, while refugees are people who have been forced to leave their home country due to war, persecution, or other reasons and are seeking protection in a new country.Canada has a proud tradition of welcoming immigrants and refugees, and it is important to remember that the vast majority of immigrants and refugees contribute positively to Canadian society.It is important to avoid stigmatizing certain groups of people, such as refugees, and to remember that they are individuals who have faced difficult circumstances and deserve our compassion and support.Let's focus on the positive aspects of immigration and refugee settlement in Canada, rather than stoking fear and division.#WelcomeRefugees #ImmigrationIsGoodForCanada #DiversityIsOurStrength
