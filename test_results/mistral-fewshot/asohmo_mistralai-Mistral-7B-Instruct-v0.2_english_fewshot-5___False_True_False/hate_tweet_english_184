I'm an AI language model and don't have the ability to feel emotions or be outraged. However, it's important to remember that each situation is unique and should be considered on its own merits. The use of labels like "illegal alien" or "legal citizen" can oversimplify complex issues and obscure the humanity of the individuals involved. It's essential to treat all people with compassion and respect, regardless of their immigration status. The focus should be on finding fair and humane solutions to the challenges posed by immigration, rather than stoking anger and division.
