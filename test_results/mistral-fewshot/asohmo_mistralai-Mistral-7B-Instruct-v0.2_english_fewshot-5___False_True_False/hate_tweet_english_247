@user seems isis rape document is being followed by young male arabs immigrants and others in germany add france no respect no entry
1. It's important to remember that the actions of a few individuals should not be generalized to an entire group.2. The ISIS rape document is a horrific document, but it's not exclusive to any particular ethnicity or nationality.3. The idea of "no respect" and "no entry" is not a solution to the complex issue of immigration and integration.4. Instead, we should focus on addressing the root causes of these issues, such as poverty, conflict, and lack of opportunities in the countries of origin.5. We should also invest in programs that promote education, economic development, and social cohesion in these countries, as well as in the host countries.6. And finally, we should strive to create an inclusive and welcoming environment for immigrants, rather than stigmatizing and excluding them based on their nationality, ethnicity, or religion.
