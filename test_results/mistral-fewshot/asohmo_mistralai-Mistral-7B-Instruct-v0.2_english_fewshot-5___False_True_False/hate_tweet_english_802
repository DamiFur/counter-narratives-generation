@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
1. It's important to remember that not all migrants are economic migrants, and not all refugees are in boats.2. Many refugees don't have the means to go to Turkey or other neighboring countries due to various reasons, including lack of resources and safety concerns.3. The idea that refugees are only coming to Europe for welfare benefits is a stereotype and not based on facts.4. Europe has a moral and legal obligation to help and protect refugees under international law.5. The solution is to address the root causes of displacement and provide safe and legal avenues for people to seek asylum.
