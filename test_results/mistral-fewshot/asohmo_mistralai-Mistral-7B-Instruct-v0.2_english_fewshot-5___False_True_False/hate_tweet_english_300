iranians either entered via greece or serbia which recklessly grants visas to iranians some iranians now fly into serbia ðÿ‰then leave for richer state in eu indirect support of illegal migration must end or others must impose sanctions on serbia to adjust attitude @user https://t co/pzhlgojaxc
1. It's important to remember that not all Iranians are involved in illegal activities.2. The issue of illegal immigration is complex and requires a multifaceted solution.3. Blaming one country for the actions of a few is not a fair or effective solution.4. Imposing sanctions on a country without considering the root causes of the issue may not address the underlying problem.5. Collaboration and communication between countries is necessary to find a solution that benefits everyone involved.
