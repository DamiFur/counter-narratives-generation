1. Orban's statement may not be entirely true, as there are still refugees in Eastern Europe.2. It's important to remember that a multicultural society doesn't have to be a poor one. In fact, many multicultural societies are economically prosperous.3. The term "refugees" refers to individuals who have been forced to leave their home countries due to war, persecution, or other forms of violence. They are not responsible for their situation and deserve compassion and support.4. George Soros, a Hungarian-American billionaire philanthropist, has been accused by some of trying to force multiculturalism on Europe through his support of refugee resettlement programs. However, this is a complex issue with many nuances, and it's important not to oversimplify it.5. Ultimately, it's essential to approach this issue with empathy and understanding, rather than fear and division. We should strive to create a world where everyone can live in safety and dignity, regardless of their background or nationality.
