@user stop being spineless and tell the eu its our country and stop migrants dictating to us via eu
1. It's not about being spineless, it's about respecting international law and human rights.2. Migrants are not dictating anything, they are seeking protection and a better life.3. The EU is not dictating, it is providing a framework for cooperation between its member states.4. Your country is part of a global community, and it's important to respect the rights and dignity of all people, regardless of their nationality or immigration status.5. Building walls and closing borders is not a solution to the complex issue of migration, it only creates division and fear.6. Let's focus on finding long-term, sustainable solutions that address the root causes of migration and ensure the safety and well-being of all people involved.
