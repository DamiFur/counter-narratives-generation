1. It's important to remember that not all immigrants are criminals or pose a threat to public safety.2. Sending them all home is not a solution to the complex issue of immigration and border control.3. We should focus on finding compassionate and effective ways to address the root causes of migration and ensure the safety and well-being of all people, regardless of their nationality or immigration status.
