"Refugees" and "illegals" are not mutually exclusive categories. Many refugees are forced to leave their countries illegally due to war, persecution, or other forms of violence. It's important to recognize the complexities of the situation and not reduce it to simplistic labels.Also, it's worth noting that the vast majority of undocumented immigrants are not "country shoppers" or criminals. They come to the US in search of a better life for themselves and their families, often fleeing poverty, violence, or political instability in their home countries.It's essential to have a nuanced and compassionate conversation about immigration, rather than resorting to fear-mongering and stereotypes.
