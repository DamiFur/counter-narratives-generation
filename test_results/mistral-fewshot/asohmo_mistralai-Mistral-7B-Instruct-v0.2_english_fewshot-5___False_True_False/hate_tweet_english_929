@user @user string him up to show the message that you will pay for your crimes in a country where you are not supposed to be in hashtag buildthatwall we are losing our legal citizens to those who should not be here in the first place if they werent here we would still have our loved ones
1. It's important to remember that not all immigrants are criminals, and not all criminals are immigrants.2. Building a wall won't solve the problem of crime, as most crimes are committed by citizens, not immigrants.3. We should focus on addressing the root causes of crime, rather than scapegoating a particular group.4. We should also remember that immigrants contribute to our society in many ways, including economically, culturally, and socially.5. Let's work towards a more compassionate and inclusive society, where everyone is valued and protected, regardless of their immigration status.
