1. It's important to remember that not all immigrants come to the US illegally, and not all undocumented immigrants are criminals.2. The education, WIC, and Medicaid programs are for US citizens and legal residents, not for illegal immigrants.3. The US has a long history of welcoming immigrants and providing them with opportunities to build a better life for themselves and their families.4. Sending people back to their countries of origin is not a solution to the complex issue of immigration. Instead, we should focus on finding a fair and humane solution that benefits both the immigrants and the US society.5. The US is a nation of laws, and it's important that we uphold those laws while also treating all individuals with dignity and respect.6. Let's work together to find a solution that respects the rule of law and the human rights of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.
