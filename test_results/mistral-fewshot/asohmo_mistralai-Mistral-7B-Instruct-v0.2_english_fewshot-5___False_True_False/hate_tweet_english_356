this would be amusing if it didnt empower our enemies libprog cucks out to little brown people (whom of course are majorities in their own countries ) hashtag whitegenocide hashtag stoptheinvasion https://t co/gjvyjoslh3
1. It's important to remember that not all immigrants are "little brown people" and not all of them are from countries with a majority population of people of color.2. The term "white genocide" is a far-right conspiracy theory and has no basis in fact.3. Empowering "enemies" and "libprogs" is not a valid reason to spread hate speech and false information.4. Invasion is not an accurate term for the movement of people seeking asylum or a better life in another country.5. Let's focus on facts, not fear and division.
