comparatively our own inner city youth & fellow americans live like 3rd class citizens while illegals are housed at ice centers that rival the best elementary schools & college dorms in the country hashtag buildthatwall @user @user @user @user @user
1. It's not accurate to say that all illegal immigrants are housed in luxurious facilities.2. It is important to address the root causes of poverty and lack of opportunities in inner cities, rather than scapegoating immigrants.3. The resources spent on immigration detention centers could be better used to improve living conditions in inner cities and provide opportunities for their residents.
