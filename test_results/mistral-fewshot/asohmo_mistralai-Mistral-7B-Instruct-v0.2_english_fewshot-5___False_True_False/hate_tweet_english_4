1. It's not only white countries that accept migrants.2. Countries have the right to decide their own immigration policies based on their resources and needs.3. We should focus on addressing the root causes of migration, such as poverty, conflict, and lack of opportunities, rather than blaming the migrants themselves.4. It is important to remember that every human being has the right to seek safety and a better life, regardless of their race or nationality.5. We should strive for a world where all people are treated with dignity and respect, and where everyone has access to the resources and opportunities they need to thrive.
