1. It's important to remember that not all migrants are a threat. Many are fleeing war, persecution, and poverty, and are seeking a better life for themselves and their families.2. The idea of a "plan orchestrated by international powers" is a conspiracy theory. There is no credible evidence to support this claim.3. Europe has a long history of welcoming immigrants and refugees, and has the resources and capacity to continue doing so.4. It is important to focus on finding long-term solutions to the root causes of migration, such as conflict, poverty, and climate change, rather than scapegoating migrants and refugees themselves.5. It is essential to promote respect for human rights and the rule of law, and to reject hate speech and xenophobia.
