I agree that not all refugees are the same, and not all of them have good intentions. However, it's important to remember that the vast majority of refugees are fleeing from war, violence, and persecution, and they deserve our compassion and support.The fact that some people have had negative experiences with refugees doesn't mean that we should close our doors to them. Instead, we should work to ensure that refugees are properly vetted and resettled in a way that benefits both them and the communities that welcome them.It's also worth noting that refugees bring many positive contributions to their new countries, including their skills, their work ethic, and their resilience.Ultimately, we need to remember that refugees are human beings, deserving of dignity and respect, and that our response to their plight should be guided by compassion and empathy, rather than fear and prejudice.
