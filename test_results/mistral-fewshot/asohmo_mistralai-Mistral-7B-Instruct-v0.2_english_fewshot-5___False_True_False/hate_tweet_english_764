a valedictorian daca illegal (is there any other kind?)took time out of her busy brain surgeon scheduleto smuggle smore4 0 med students &amp quantum physicists illegal s into the us she musta heard that we were gonna use a merit-based immigration system https://t co/bppfv8har5
1. It's unlikely that a brain surgeon would have the time and resources to smuggle people into the country.2. Merit-based doesn't mean illegal, it means selecting people based on their skills and qualifications.3. There are legal ways for people to come to the US to study, like student visas.4. Stereotyping all immigrants as criminals or burdens is not fair or accurate.
