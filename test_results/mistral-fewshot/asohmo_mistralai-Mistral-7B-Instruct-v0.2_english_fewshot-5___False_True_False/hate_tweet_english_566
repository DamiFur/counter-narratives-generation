@user @user agree with your idea to use the army to build the wall do it hashtag buildthatwall hashtag buildthewall
1. Using the military to build a wall goes against the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which prohibits the use of the military for law enforcement within the United States, except in certain circumstances.2. Building a wall is not a solution to the complex issue of immigration and border security.3. It's important to remember that immigrants, including those who are undocumented, are human beings and should be treated with dignity and respect.4. Instead of focusing on building a wall, we should be working on comprehensive immigration reform that addresses the root causes of migration and provides a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants.5. We should also be investing in technology, infrastructure, and personnel to secure our borders effectively and humanely.6. And finally, let's not forget that the United States is a nation of immigrants, and we should be welcoming people from all over the world who want to contribute to our society and economy.
