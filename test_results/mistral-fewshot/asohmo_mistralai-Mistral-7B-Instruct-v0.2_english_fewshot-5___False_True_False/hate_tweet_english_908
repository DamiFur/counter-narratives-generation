learn from most of hashtag europe thats been hashtag invaded by mostly muslims then look at hashtag italy hashtag poland & others who elected politicians to hashtag stopim migration & hashtag deportillegals hashtag sweden & hashtag germany now trying to reverse the huge mistakes of unlimited migration of ppl who refuse to hashtag assimilate
1. It's important to remember that not all immigrants refuse to assimilate and that generalizations can be harmful.2. The situation in Europe is complex and multifaceted, and it's not accurate to oversimplify it as an "invasion" by "mostly Muslims."3. The decision to stop immigration and deport illegals is a matter of policy and should be based on facts and evidence, not fear or prejudice.4. Sending people "home" is not always a simple solution and can have unintended consequences, such as creating instability in their home countries or separating families.5. It is important to consider the human rights and dignity of immigrants and to treat them with respect and compassion, regardless of their legal status or place of origin.6. It is also important to address the root causes of migration, such as poverty, violence, and political instability, rather than just focusing on the symptoms.7. Finally, it is important to have a nuanced and informed conversation about immigration, rather than relying on slogans and hashtags that oversimplify a complex issue.
