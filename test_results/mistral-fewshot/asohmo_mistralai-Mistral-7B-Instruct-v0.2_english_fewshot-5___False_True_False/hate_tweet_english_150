1. DACA recipients are not illegal immigrants, they were brought to the US as children and are protected from deportation under DACA.2. The number of illegal votes is a myth, there is no credible evidence to support this claim.3. Democrats do not want "no walls or borders," they support secure borders and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.4. Voter ID laws do not prevent voter fraud, they disproportionately affect marginalized communities and make it harder for them to exercise their right to vote.5. The President and his supporters often use fear-mongering and misinformation to justify their policies, but the facts do not support their claims.
