problem for the pm re johnson is that a person who sent round vans telling immigrants to go home is not in a position to lecture anyone on racism the lesson of which is: if you pander theyll take everything you give them and keep pushing for more
I agree that actions speak louder than words. It's important for leaders to practice what they preach, especially when it comes to sensitive issues like immigration and racism.However, it's also important to remember that every individual and situation is unique, and it's not fair to judge someone solely based on one action or statement. People can change and learn from their mistakes.Regarding your point about pandering, I believe it's a complex issue. On one hand, politicians may use certain language or policies to appeal to specific groups for political gain. On the other hand, addressing the concerns and needs of certain communities can lead to positive change and progress for society as a whole.It's crucial for us as citizens to hold our leaders accountable for their actions and words, and to demand transparency and authenticity from them. At the same time, we should also strive to understand the complexities of the issues at hand and work towards finding solutions that benefit everyone, rather than resorting to divisive rhetoric and hate speech.
