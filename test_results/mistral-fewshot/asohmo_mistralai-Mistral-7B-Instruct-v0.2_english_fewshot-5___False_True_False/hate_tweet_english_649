1. It's important to remember that not all immigrants are illegal, and not all illegal immigrants are violent criminals.2. The United States is a nation of immigrants and has always been a beacon of hope and opportunity for people from all over the world.3. Sending people "back" to countries they may not even know or have a connection to is not a solution to the complex issue of immigration.4. The Fourth of July is a time to celebrate the freedoms and values that make America great, not to spread hate and divisiveness.5. Let's focus on finding compassionate and effective solutions to the issue of immigration, rather than demonizing entire groups of people.6. #BuildBridgesNotWalls #ImmigrationReform #CompassionateSolutions.
