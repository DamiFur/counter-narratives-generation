@user theres an agenda jprdan: white genocide is a crime eu funded report tells journalists not to write negative articles on migrant crisis "it even urges them to report colleagues to the authorities for hate speech crimes "https://t
1. The term "white genocide" is a far-right conspiracy theory with no basis in fact.2. The idea that the EU is funding a report to suppress negative articles about the migrant crisis is not supported by evidence.3. Encouraging journalists to report their colleagues for hate speech is a common practice in many countries to maintain ethical standards in journalism.4. It's important to remember that freedom of speech is a fundamental human right, but it doesn't give anyone the right to spread hate speech or misinformation.5. Let's focus on facts and evidence, rather than conspiracy theories and fear-mongering.
