1. It's important to note that not all refugees are criminals, and not all NGOs are involved in illegal activities.2. The issue of refugees and migration is complex, and it's not a simple matter of "banning them from their territory."3. Instead, we should focus on finding long-term, sustainable solutions to address the root causes of migration, such as poverty, conflict, and persecution.4. We should also work to ensure that refugees are treated with dignity and respect, and that they have access to the resources and support they need to rebuild their lives.5. Ultimately, it's in everyone's best interest to find a compassionate and effective response to the refugee crisis, rather than resorting to fear and division.
