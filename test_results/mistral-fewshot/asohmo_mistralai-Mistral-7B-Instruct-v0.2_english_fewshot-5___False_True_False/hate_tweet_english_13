1. It's important to remember that not all immigrants are "illegal" and not all of them are from "third world" countries.2. Many immigrants contribute positively to society and pay taxes.3. Deporting people and separating families is not a solution to the complex issue of immigration.4. Building a wall will not solve the problem either, as many immigrants come legally or overstay their visas.5. A more compassionate and comprehensive approach is needed to address the root causes of immigration and find a fair and just solution for all parties involved.
