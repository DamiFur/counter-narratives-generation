1. It's important to remember that every country has the right to decide its own immigration policies based on its resources and needs.2. The U.S. has a responsibility to help those in need, but it's also crucial to ensure that its own citizens are taken care of first.3. The cost of taking in refugees can be significant, but the long-term benefits, such as economic growth and social integration, can outweigh the initial investment.4. The issue is complex and requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach that balances the needs of refugees with the needs of the American people.5. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits everyone, rather than resorting to divisive and hateful rhetoric. #compassion #solutionfocused #togetherwecan #refugeeswelcome #buildbridgesnotwalls
