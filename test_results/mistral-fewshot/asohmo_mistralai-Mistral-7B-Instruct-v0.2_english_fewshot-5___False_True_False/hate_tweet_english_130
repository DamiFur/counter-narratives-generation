1. It's important to differentiate between refugees and tourists. Refugees are people who have been forced to leave their homes due to war, persecution, or other dangerous conditions. They are in need of protection and assistance, not discrimination.2. The fact that some refugees may enter a country without proper documentation or registration does not justify discrimination against all refugees or the denial of their basic human rights.3. It is the responsibility of governments and international organizations to ensure that refugees are registered, processed, and resettled in a safe and orderly manner.4. It is important to remember that the vast majority of refugees are not a threat to public safety, and that they are fleeing from the very same violence and instability that we condemn.5. Instead of spreading fear and hate, let's focus on finding solutions to the root causes of displacement and on providing support and protection to those in need.
