1. It's important to remember that everyone deserves respect and dignity, regardless of their immigration status.2. The term "illegals" is not an accurate or respectful term for immigrants who are living in a country without proper documentation. They are human beings, not criminals.3. Building a wall or closing a border does not solve the root causes of why people are leaving their home countries. It is important to address the underlying issues, such as poverty, violence, and lack of opportunity, in order to prevent people from feeling the need to leave in the first place.4. It is also important to consider the economic and humanitarian implications of turning away refugees and immigrants. Many countries, including Canada and the United States, have a long history of welcoming immigrants and have benefited greatly from their contributions to society.5. Lastly, it is important to engage in respectful and productive dialogue about immigration and border issues, rather than resorting to hateful and divisive language. Let's focus on finding solutions that are fair, just, and compassionate for all involved.
