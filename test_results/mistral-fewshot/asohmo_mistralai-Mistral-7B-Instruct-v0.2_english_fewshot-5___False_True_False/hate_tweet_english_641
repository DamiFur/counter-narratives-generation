1. It's important to note that providing aid to countries is not the same as creating concentration camps.2. The EU's actions are aimed at addressing the root causes of the refugee crisis, rather than just dealing with the symptoms.3. The use of the term "concentration camps" is inflammatory and inappropriate, as it implies something far more sinister than what is actually happening.
