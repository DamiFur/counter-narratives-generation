1. It's important to note that not all refugees are illegal immigrants. Refugees go through a rigorous vetting process before entering the country.2. The number of refugees admitted to the US is a humanitarian issue, not a budget one.3. The nine federal contractors mentioned in the tweet are non-profit organizations that help refugees resettle in the US. They play a crucial role in ensuring the successful integration of refugees into American society.4. Reducing the number of refugees allowed into the US would not only be a violation of human rights, but it would also harm these organizations and the communities they serve.5. It is essential to remember that refugees are human beings who have been forced to flee their homes due to violence, war, or persecution. They are not a threat to the US, but rather an asset to our society.Therefore, it is important to challenge the narrative that refugees are a burden and instead focus on the positive contributions they bring to our communities.
