1. Deportation is not a solution to crime, as the vast majority of undocumented immigrants are law-abiding citizens.2. Ending programs like DACA does not solve the issue of criminal immigrants, as it only affects those who came to the US as children.3. Building a wall will not stop illegal immigration, as people will find other ways to enter the country.4. Ending sanctuary cities and chain migration does not address the root causes of illegal immigration.5. Mandatory E-Verify is a step in the right direction, but it is not a complete solution.Instead, we should focus on comprehensive immigration reform that addresses the needs of both the immigrants and the US economy. This includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented individuals, increased border security, and a fair and efficient legal immigration system.Let's work together to find a solution that benefits everyone, rather than spreading hate and fear. #ImmigrationReform #CompassionateSolutions #TogetherWeCan #EndThePolarization.
