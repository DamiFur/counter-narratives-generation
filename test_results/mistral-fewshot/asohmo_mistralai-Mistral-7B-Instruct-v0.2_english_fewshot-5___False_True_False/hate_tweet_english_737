1. It's important to distinguish between refugees and illegal immigrants. Refugees are people fleeing from war or persecution, and they have the right to seek asylum under international law.2. Turkey has already taken in a large number of refugees from Syria, and it's commendable that they have done so. However, it's also important for the international community to help share the burden and provide support to countries like Turkey that have taken in large numbers of refugees.3. Instead of focusing on building walls or keeping people out, it would be more productive to focus on finding long-term solutions to the root causes of migration and displacement, such as conflict, poverty, and lack of opportunity.4. It is important to remember that refugees are human beings who deserve dignity, safety, and the opportunity to rebuild their lives. They are not a threat to anyone's survival, but rather a potential asset to any community that welcomes them.5. Let's work together to find compassionate and sustainable solutions to the refugee crisis, rather than resorting to fear and division.
