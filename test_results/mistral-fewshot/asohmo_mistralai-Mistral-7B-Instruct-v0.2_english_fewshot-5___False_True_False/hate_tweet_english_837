@user guatemala is sending their finest hashtag buildthatwall
1. It's not clear what you mean by "their finest".2. Building a wall won't solve the root causes of the problem, such as poverty and violence in Guatemala.3. A wall is not a solution to the complex issue of immigration.4. It is important to remember that most immigrants are not criminals, but hardworking people seeking a better life for themselves and their families.5. Instead of building walls, we should be working together to find solutions that benefit all parties involved.6. Let's focus on finding common ground and building bridges, not walls.7. We should strive for a world where everyone has the opportunity to live in peace and prosperity, regardless of their nationality or place of birth.8. Let us remember that we are all human beings, deserving of respect and dignity.9. Let us reject hate speech and work towards a more inclusive and compassionate society.10. Let us build a future where everyone can thrive, not just a select few.#buildbridgesnotwalls #compassion #inclusion #respect #dignity #humanityfirst
