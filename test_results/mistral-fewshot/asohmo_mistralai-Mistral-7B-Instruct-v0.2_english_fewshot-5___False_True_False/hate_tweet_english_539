@user will islam ever be at peace with its self as it goes to war with itsel f no wonder uk people do not accept its refugees
1. It's important to remember that not all Muslims support or engage in violence.2. The idea that Islam as a whole is at war with itself is a simplistic and inaccurate view.3. The acceptance or rejection of refugees should be based on compassion and human rights, not fear or prejudice.
