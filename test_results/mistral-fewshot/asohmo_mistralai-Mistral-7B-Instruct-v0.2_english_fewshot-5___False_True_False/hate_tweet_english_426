@user did you forget?? stop trying to give credibility to an illegal immigrant with an anchor baby &amp chain migration parents who wore an fing "i really dont care" trench coat to the border in 90 degree weather she is irrelevant hashtag msnbc hashtag vel
1. Anchor babies are US citizens by birthright, regardless of their parents' immigration status.2. Chain migration refers to the process by which U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents (LPRs) sponsor family members for immigrant visas.3. The "I really don't care" jacket comment was made by Melania Trump, not the President.4. MSNBC is a news channel, not a person.5. Irrelevant to the topic of countering hate speech.
