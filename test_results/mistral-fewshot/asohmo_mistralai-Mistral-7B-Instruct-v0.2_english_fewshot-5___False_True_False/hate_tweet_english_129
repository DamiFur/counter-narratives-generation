1. It's important to remember that not all undocumented immigrants or refugees are criminals. In fact, studies have shown that they are less likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens.2. The term "illegal aliens" is a derogatory term that dehumanizes people. Instead, it's more accurate and respectful to use terms like "undocumented immigrants" or "unauthorized migrants."3. The DACA program, which allows certain undocumented young people to temporarily live and work in the US without fear of deportation, has been shown to have positive economic and social impacts.4. The idea of sending people "back across the border" is a simplistic solution to a complex issue. Many of these individuals have lived in the US for years, have families and communities here, and would face significant challenges if forced to return to their countries of origin.5. Lastly, the term "refugees invaders" is inflammatory and inaccurate. Refugees are individuals who have been forced to flee their home countries due to war, persecution, or other forms of violence. They are not invaders, but rather individuals in need of protection and support.
