1. It's important to remember that not all immigrants are illegal, and not all illegal immigrants are Hispanic or from Latin America.2. There is evidence that overall, immigrants contribute more to the economy than they take out.3. The wage impact on native-born workers is a complex issue, with studies showing both positive and negative effects depending on various factors.4. The idea that immigrants take jobs away from native-born Americans is not supported by evidence.5. The "WalkAway" movement is a political campaign, not a factual statement.
