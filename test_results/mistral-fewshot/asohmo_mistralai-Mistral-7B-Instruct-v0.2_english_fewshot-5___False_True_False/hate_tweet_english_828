"@user a special team of 100 people be made under a most respected rtd judge let them visit each indian state camp there &amp identify all the illegal migrants &amp people with expired visas govt then must ensure immediate deportation for the"
1. It's important to remember that not all immigrants are illegal, and not all illegal immigrants are from India.2. Creating a special team to identify and deport people is a costly and time-consuming process. It would require significant resources and manpower.3. The idea of a "most respected RTD judge" making such a decision is not practical, as the judiciary is an independent branch of government.4. Deportation is a complex process that involves more than just identifying someone as an illegal immigrant. There are legal, logistical, and humanitarian considerations that must be taken into account.5. It is also important to consider the potential consequences of mass deportations, such as the impact on families, communities, and economies.6. A more effective and humane approach would be to focus on comprehensive immigration reform that addresses the root causes of illegal immigration and provides a pathway to legal status for those who are already here.
