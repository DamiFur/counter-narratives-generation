1. It's important to remember that not all immigrants are the same, and not all of them pose a threat.2. The term "white genocide" is a far-right conspiracy theory and has no basis in fact.3. Your use of the term "invasion" is inflammatory and inaccurate.4. The World Cup is a sporting event, not a cause for xenophobia or racism.5. Macron is the President of France, not the cause of France's problems.6. Sending people "home" is not a solution to complex social and economic issues.7. It is important to promote unity and understanding, rather than division and fear.
