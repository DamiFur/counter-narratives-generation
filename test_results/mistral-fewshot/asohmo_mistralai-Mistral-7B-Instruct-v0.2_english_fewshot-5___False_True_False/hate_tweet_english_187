1. It's important to remember that the judge's decision is based on the law and the facts of the case, not personal opinions or political affiliations.2. The cost of illegal immigration and the taxes paid by undocumented immigrants are two different things. The former refers to the financial burden on the government, while the latter refers to the revenue generated by their labor.3. The economic impact of illegal immigration is complex and multifaceted. While it's true that some costs are incurred, it's also important to consider the benefits, such as filling labor gaps in certain industries and contributing to the economy through consumption and entrepreneurship.4. The DACA program, which allows certain undocumented individuals who came to the US as children to remain in the country without fear of deportation, is a separate issue from illegal immigration as a whole.5. Ultimately, the debate over immigration policy should be based on facts, evidence, and a consideration of the long-term interests of the country and its people, rather than short-term political gains or fear-mongering.
