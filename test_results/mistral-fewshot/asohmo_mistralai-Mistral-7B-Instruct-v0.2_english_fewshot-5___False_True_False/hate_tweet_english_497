@user i just read the guy that broke into many homes including chef jaime oliver was let go but dont call a refugee a rapefugee or the soros sponsored police of the uk will not let you go
1. It's important to differentiate between individuals and groups. Not all refugees are criminals, and not all criminals are refugees.2. The term "rapefugee" is a hateful and derogatory term that should not be used.3. George Soros is a business magnate and philanthropist, not a sponsor of the UK police.4. The freedom of speech is a fundamental right, but it's essential to use it responsibly and respectfully towards others.
