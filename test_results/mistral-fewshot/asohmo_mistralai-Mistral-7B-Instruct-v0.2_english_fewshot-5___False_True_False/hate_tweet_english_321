1. Europe is a diverse continent with many different cultures and religions. Not all Europeans share the same views on immigration.2. It's important to remember that not all Muslims are responsible for the actions of a few extremists.3. Free speech is a fundamental right, but it should not be used to spread hate or intolerance.4. Let's focus on finding solutions that respect the human rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their nationality or religion.5. The EU and its member states should work together to address the root causes of migration and find humane and effective ways to manage migration flows.
