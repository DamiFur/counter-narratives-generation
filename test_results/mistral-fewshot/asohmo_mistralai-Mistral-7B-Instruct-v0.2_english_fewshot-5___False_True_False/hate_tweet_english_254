but i thought hashtag white genocide wasnt real? hashtag deportthemigrants hashtag refugees notwelcome hashtag white pride
1. "White genocide" is not a real thing. It's a term coined by white supremacists to spread fear and hate.2. Deporting migrants and refusing refugees entry does not make a country great. It goes against human rights and international law.3. Pride in one's race or ethnicity is not inherently bad, but it becomes problematic when it's used to discriminate against others.
