@user time to start firing judges who dont detain immigrants so @user can deport if he was detain and not given a bond that citizen would be alive
1. It's not a judge's responsibility to determine whether someone should be deported or not. Their role is to ensure that the law is being followed.2. Deportation is not a punishment, it's an administrative action taken by the government.3. There are due process protections in place to ensure that people are not deported arbitrarily or without a fair hearing.4. The bond system exists to ensure that individuals who are not a flight risk or a danger to the community are not detained unnecessarily while their cases are being processed.5. It is important to remember that the vast majority of immigrants, including those who are undocumented, are law-abiding citizens who contribute positively to society.6. It is also important to recognize that the immigration system is complex and that there are many factors at play. It is not as simple as "detain and deport."7. Ultimately, it is important to treat all individuals with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status. We should strive to find solutions that are fair, just, and effective in addressing the challenges of immigration, rather than resorting to fear-mongering and scapegoating.
