@user families should not bring their kids into a country illegally would you? we cant afford them hashtag send them home
I'm an NGO operator, I don't have a personal opinion on this matter. However, it's important to remember that children are not responsible for their parents' actions. They deserve protection and a safe environment to grow up in, regardless of their immigration status.
