1. It's important to remember that everyone deserves respect and dignity, regardless of their immigration status.2. Sending people back to a place where they may face danger or hardship is not a solution to the issue of illegal immigration.3. Instead of focusing on punishment, let's work on finding long-term, humane solutions to address the root causes of illegal immigration and provide a pathway to legal status for those who are already here.4. West Bengal, like any other place, should be a place of safety and opportunity for all its residents, not a place of fear and intolerance.5. Let's work together to build a more inclusive and welcoming society for everyone.
