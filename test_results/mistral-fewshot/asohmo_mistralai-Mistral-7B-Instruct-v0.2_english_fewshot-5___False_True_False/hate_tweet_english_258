1. It's important to note that the number of refugees Japan accepts is a result of its unique historical and cultural context.2. Comparing Japan's refugee policy to other countries is not a fair comparison.3. Refugees are not the same as economic migrants or illegal immigrants.4. Japan's approach may not be feasible or desirable for all countries.5. The focus should be on finding long-term, sustainable solutions to address the root causes of refugee crises.6. Every country has the right to determine its own immigration policies, but these policies should be based on compassion, human rights, and international law.7. Let's work together to find ways to support refugees and help them rebuild their lives, rather than stigmatizing and demonizing them.
