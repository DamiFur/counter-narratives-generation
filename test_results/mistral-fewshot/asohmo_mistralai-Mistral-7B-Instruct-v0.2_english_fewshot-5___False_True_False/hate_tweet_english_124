@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
Immigrants come from a country, they don't belong to a country. They have the right to seek asylum or work in another country, but that doesn't mean they lose their original nationality or identity.It's important to remember that everyone deserves respect and dignity, regardless of their nationality or immigration status. Let's focus on building bridges, not walls. #BuildBridgesNotWalls #EmbraceDiversity #HumanRightsForAll
