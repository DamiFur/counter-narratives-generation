1. It's not clear what you mean by "globalist" in this context. Are you referring to people who advocate for international cooperation and interconnectedness, or something else?2. Building a wall doesn't solve the root causes of social chaos, it only addresses one aspect of the issue.3. Order and chaos are not mutually exclusive, and it's not necessarily true that chaos leads to the need for an all-powerful superstate.4. It is important to consider the long-term consequences of actions, not just short-term solutions.
