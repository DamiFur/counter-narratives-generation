1. It's important to remember that not all refugees are drunk, and not all who stay in their home countries are safe from harm.2. Everyone has the right to seek a better life, and it's not fair to judge them based on stereotypes.3. The journey to a new country can be dangerous, but it's often the only option for those who face persecution or violence in their own countries.4. Providing support and resources to refugees, rather than stigmatizing them, is a more compassionate and effective approach.
