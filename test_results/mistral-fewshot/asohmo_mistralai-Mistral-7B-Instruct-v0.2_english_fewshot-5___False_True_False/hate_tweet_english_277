@user @user americas public assistance medicare medicaid ss et al are strained and americans "benefits" are being cut not even able to maintain status quo no immigrants should be granted entry that need assistance hashtag nodaca hashtag norefuge
1. It's important to note that not all immigrants use public assistance, and many contribute more to the economy than they take out.2. The U.S. has a responsibility to help those in need, regardless of their immigration status.3. DACA recipients, for example, are not eligible for most public assistance programs.4. Refusing entry to those who need assistance is not a solution to the problem, and it goes against the values of compassion and fairness.5. Instead, we should focus on finding comprehensive solutions that address the root causes of poverty and inequality, and ensure that everyone, regardless of immigration status, has access to the resources they need to thrive.
