1. The Access to Counsel Act aims to ensure that everyone, regardless of their immigration status, has access to legal representation. This is a fundamental human right.2. Building a wall and ending DACA, chain migration, and diversity lottery are not solutions to the complex issue of immigration.3. It's important to remember that the vast majority of immigrants are law-abiding citizens who contribute positively to our society.4. The United States is a nation of immigrants, and we should strive to uphold the values of fairness, equality, and justice for all.5. Let's focus on comprehensive immigration reform that addresses the root causes of migration and provides a pathway to legal status for those who are already here.6. #BuildBridgesNotWalls #FairImmigrationReform #DiversityIsOurStrength
