1. It's important to remember that not all immigrants are illegal and not all illegal immigrants are from one specific religion or ethnicity.2. Deporting all "illegal" immigrants would be a logistical and financial challenge.3. Threats and intimidation should not be the basis for policy decisions.4. It is crucial to uphold the rule of law and protect the human rights of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.5. It is important to address the root causes of why people are leaving their countries and coming to India in the first place, rather than just focusing on the symptoms.6.
