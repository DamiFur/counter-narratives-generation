1. Sanctuary cities are not against the law, they are cities that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.2. Arresting and prosecuting governors and mayors for following their own policies would be a violation of their constitutional rights.3. It's important to remember that the vast majority of immigrants, including those protected by DACA, are law-abiding citizens who contribute positively to society.4. The Constitution guarantees protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, as well as the right to due process and equal protection under the law.5. Ending sanctuary cities and DACA would not make America great again, it would only create more division and fear in our communities.6. Congress should focus on comprehensive immigration reform that addresses the root causes of migration and provides a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.
