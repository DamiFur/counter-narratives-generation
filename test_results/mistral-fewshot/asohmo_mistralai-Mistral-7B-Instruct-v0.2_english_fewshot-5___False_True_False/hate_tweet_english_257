1. It's important to remember that MS-13 members are criminals, regardless of their immigration status.2. The number of criminals among undocumented immigrants is very small compared to the overall population.3. Building a wall won't solve the problem, as many criminals come through legal ports of entry or overstay their visas.4. The U.S. has a responsibility to protect the human rights of all people, including those who have come to this country as children through no fault of their own.5. Ending DACA would cause harm to thousands of young people who have grown up in the U.S., many of whom have no memory of their home country.6. Enforcing our laws should be done in a fair and just manner, taking into account the individual circumstances of each case.7. Keeping America safe requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of crime and violence, rather than scapegoating a particular group.
