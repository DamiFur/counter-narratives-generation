@user stop being spineless and tell the eu its our country and stop migrants dictating to us via eu
1. It's not about being spineless, it's about treating everyone with respect and dignity.2. Not all migrants are part of the EU, and not all EU citizens are migrants.3. The EU is a political and economic union, not a monolithic entity.4. Stereotyping and blaming an entire group for the actions of a few is not a solution.5. Let's focus on finding common ground and building bridges, not walls.
