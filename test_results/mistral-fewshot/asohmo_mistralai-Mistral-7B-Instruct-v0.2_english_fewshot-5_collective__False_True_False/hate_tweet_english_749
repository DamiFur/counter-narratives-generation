problem for the pm re johnson is that a person who sent round vans telling immigrants to go home is not in a position to lecture anyone on racism the lesson of which is: if you pander theyll take everything you give them and keep pushing for more
1. It's important to remember that actions speak louder than words.2. The PM's past actions do not make him an expert on the issue of racism.3. Instead of focusing on the past, let's focus on the present and work towards creating a more inclusive and welcoming society.4. We should strive to understand the root causes of people's fears and address them in a compassionate and effective way.5. Let's remember that everyone deserves respect and dignity, regardless of their background or nationality.6. We can challenge hate speech by promoting positive and inclusive narratives, and by standing up against discrimination and intolerance in all its forms.7. We can also support organizations and initiatives that work to promote social cohesion and build bridges between different communities.8. Ultimately, it's up to all of us to create a society where everyone feels welcome and valued, and where hate speech and discrimination are not tolerated.
