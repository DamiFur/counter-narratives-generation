1. It's important to remember that not all immigrants use public assistance and many contribute to the economy through taxes and labor.2. There are legal ways for immigrants to come to the US and access public assistance, such as becoming a citizen or obtaining a green card.3. The US has a long history of welcoming immigrants and providing them with opportunities to build better lives for themselves and their families.4. Denying entry to those who need assistance is not a solution to the issue of strained public resources. Instead, we should focus on finding ways to address the root causes of poverty and inequality, both in the US and in the countries from which immigrants are coming.5. Refusing to help those in need, regardless of their immigration status, is not in line with American values of compassion and fairness.6. The DACA program, which allows certain undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children to remain in the country without fear of deportation, is not a reward. It is a recognition of the fact that these individuals have grown up in the US, have contributed to society, and deserve a chance to continue building their lives here.7. Refugees, on the other hand, are individuals who have been forced to flee their home countries due to war, persecution, or other forms of violence.
