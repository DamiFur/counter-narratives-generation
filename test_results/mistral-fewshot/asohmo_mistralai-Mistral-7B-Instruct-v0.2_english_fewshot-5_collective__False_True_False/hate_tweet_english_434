@user who care for these children of criminal refugees really they play no role in times of overpopulation
1. It's important to remember that not all refugees are criminals.2. And even if some are, it's not fair to punish innocent children for their parents' actions.3. Overpopulation is a complex issue that can't be solved by discriminating against certain groups.4. We should focus on finding solutions that benefit everyone, rather than spreading hate and fear.
