@user @user and meanwhile as they bicker our lettuce strainer of a border sees well dressed and outfitted " refugees " (code for country shoppers ) other illegals and undocumented crossing the border daily https://t co/ghvm5izviu
1. It's important to remember that not all refugees are "well-dressed" or "country shoppers." Many are fleeing war, persecution, and poverty.2. The term "lettuce strainer" is a derogatory term used to describe the border wall, which is not an effective solution to the complex issue of immigration.3. It is not fair to stereotype all refugees based on the actions of a few.4. The focus should be on finding long-term, humane solutions to address the root causes of migration and ensure the safety and security of all communities involved.
