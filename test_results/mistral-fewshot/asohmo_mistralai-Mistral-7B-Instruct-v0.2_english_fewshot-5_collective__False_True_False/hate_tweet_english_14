many lice you will find in viennese schools some refugees has brought us this as gift to rescue it will cost 30 â‚¬ a person https://t co/uav43bylfb
1. It's important to remember that not all refugees bring lice, and not all refugees are responsible for the presence of lice in Viennese schools.2. The cost of treating lice is a small price to pay for the benefits that refugees bring to society as a whole.3. Blaming refugees for a problem that could have multiple causes is not fair or productive.4. Let's focus on finding long-term solutions to prevent the spread of lice and other health issues in schools, rather than scapegoating refugees.5. Instead of spreading hate speech, let's work together to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all members of our community.
