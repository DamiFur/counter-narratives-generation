1. It's important to remember that not all migrants or immigrants are the same. There are legal and illegal immigrants, and it's crucial to differentiate between them.2. Violence and crime are not exclusive to any particular group of people, regardless of their origin.3. Labeling a whole group based on the actions of a few individuals is not fair or accurate.4. It is essential to address the root causes of crime and violence, rather than focusing solely on the nationality or ethnicity of the perpetrators.5.
