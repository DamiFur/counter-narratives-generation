learn from most of hashtag europe thats been hashtag invaded by mostly muslims then look at hashtag italy hashtag poland & others who elected politicians to hashtag stopim migration & hashtag deportillegals hashtag sweden & hashtag germany now trying to reverse the huge mistakes of unlimited migration of ppl who refuse to hashtag assimilate
1. It's important to remember that not all Muslims are the same, and it's unfair to stereotype an entire group based on the actions of a few.2. The term "unlimited migration" is not an accurate description of what happened in Europe. Most European countries have strict immigration policies and procedures in place.3. Assimilation is a two-way process that requires effort from both the newcomers and the host society. It is not the sole responsibility of newcomers to assimilate, and it is important for the host society to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for them.4. It is also important to note that there are many successful examples of Muslim immigrants who have assimilated and contributed positively to their adopted countries.5. It is important to focus on solutions that address the root causes of conflict and instability in the countries of origin, rather than scapegoating and stigmatizing entire groups of people.
