@user sheme there is no attention on our own people and foodbanks while do you have to be a migrant to be treated with respect?
1. Attention should be given to those in need, regardless of their nationality or immigration status.2. Everyone deserves respect as a human being.3. It's important to address the root causes of poverty and inequality, rather than scapegoating certain groups.
