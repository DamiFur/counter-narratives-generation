1. It's important to remember that not all Chinese people support their government's actions, and not all Americans want a wall or a strong economy at the expense of others.2. The idea of a "red tsunami" or a "blue wave" is a simplification and an oversimplification of complex political dynamics.3. Claims of "Russian interference" should be backed up with evidence, not just thrown around as an accusation.
