1. It's important to remember that not all illegal immigrants use children as a get-out-of-jail-card.2. Detaining and deporting all illegal immigrants is not a feasible or humane solution.3. Catch-and-release is not a policy, it's a term used to describe the process of releasing immigrants on bond or parole while their cases are being processed.4. Sending them back "asap" doesn't address the root causes of why they came to the US in the first place.5. The term "red nation rising" is not a widely recognized term, and it's unclear what it refers to in this context.6. The use of the term "illegals" is dehumanizing and not helpful in addressing the complex issue of immigration.Instead, let's focus on finding a comprehensive and humane solution to the issue of illegal immigration, one that addresses the root causes and provides a pathway to legal status for those who are already here.
