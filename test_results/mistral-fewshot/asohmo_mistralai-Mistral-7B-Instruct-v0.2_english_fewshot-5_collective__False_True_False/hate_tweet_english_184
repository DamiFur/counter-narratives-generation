1. It's important to remember that not all illegal aliens are the same, and not all of them are violent criminals.2. The woman's situation is tragic, but it doesn't justify hating on an entire group of people.3. The "Families Belong Together" movement is about keeping families together, not just for illegal aliens, but for all families, regardless of their immigration status.4. The focus should be on finding a humane and fair solution for both the woman and the illegal alien community.5. Let's not forget that many illegal aliens come to the US to escape violence, poverty, and other hardships in their home countries.6. Instead of hate and division, let's promote understanding, compassion, and unity.7. The US has a long history of welcoming immigrants, and it's important that we continue to do so in a way that respects the rule of law and protects the safety and well-being of all Americans.
