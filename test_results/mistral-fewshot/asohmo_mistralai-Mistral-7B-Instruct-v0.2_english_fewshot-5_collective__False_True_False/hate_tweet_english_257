The actions of a few should not be used to condemn an entire group.3. The focus should be on addressing the root causes of crime and gang activity, rather than targeting a specific group based on their immigration status.4. Laws should be enforced fairly and justly, without discrimination or prejudice.5. There are many ways to protect America and keep Americans safe beyond building a wall or ending DACA.6.
