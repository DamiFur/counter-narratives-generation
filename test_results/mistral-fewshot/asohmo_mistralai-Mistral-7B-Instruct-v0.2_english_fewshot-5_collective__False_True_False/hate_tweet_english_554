1. The number of illegal immigrants in the US is estimated to be around 11 million, not 15 million.2. Giving more congressional seats to blue states is not a result of the presence of illegal immigrants, but rather a result of population demographics.3. Illegal immigrants do not have the right to vote in federal elections, so they cannot directly influence the number of congressional seats a state has.4. It is important to remember that illegal immigrants are human beings and deserve respect and dignity, regardless of their legal status.5. Focusing on building a wall or denying them amnesty does not address the root causes of why people come to the US illegally, such as poverty, violence, and lack of opportunities in their home countries. Instead, we should be working towards comprehensive immigration reform that addresses these issues and provides a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants.
