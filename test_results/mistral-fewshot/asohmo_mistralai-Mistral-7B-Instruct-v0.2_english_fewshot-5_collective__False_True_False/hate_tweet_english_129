1. It's important to remember that not all refugees or illegal immigrants bring crime. Many contribute positively to society.2. The term "invaders" is a derogatory and inflammatory term that is not helpful in addressing the issue in a constructive manner.3. Sending people back to Mexico or their home countries is not a solution for everyone. There are complex reasons why people flee their homes and seek refuge in other countries, and simply sending them back without addressing the root causes of their displacement will not solve the problem.4. It is also important to note that the vast majority of refugees and illegal immigrants do not pose a threat to American citizens. In fact, studies have shown that refugees are less likely to commit crimes than the native-born population.5. Instead of focusing on hate and fear, it would be more productive to work towards finding solutions that address the underlying causes of displacement and provide safe and legal avenues for people to seek refuge and build new lives in other countries.
