1. It's important to note that asylum is not the same as illegal immigration. Asylum seekers are individuals who are fleeing persecution in their home countries and are seeking protection under international law.2. The one-year time limit for filing an asylum application in the US applies to those who enter the country illegally. However, there are exceptions to this rule, such as when an applicant can demonstrate that the circumstances preventing them from filing within one year were beyond their control.3. Deporting individuals who have been living in the US for years and have deep roots in the community is a complex issue that requires a nuanced approach. It is important to consider the individual circumstances of each case and the potential consequences of deportation for both the individual and their loved ones.4. It is also important to remember that the vast majority of undocumented immigrants are not criminals and do not pose a threat to public safety. They are hardworking individuals who contribute to the US economy and society in many ways.5. Finally, it is important to address the root causes of migration, such as poverty, violence, and political instability, in order to reduce the incentive for individuals to migrate illegally in the first place. This can be done through diplomacy, foreign aid, and other means.
