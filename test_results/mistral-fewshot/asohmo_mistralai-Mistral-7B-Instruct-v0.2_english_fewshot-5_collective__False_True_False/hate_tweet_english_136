for all the people holding up signs regarding illegal immigrants hand them each a bill to pay the cost of how much these people take from the american taxpayer and i bet they would take down their signs and go home
1. It's not fair to generalize that all illegal immigrants are a burden on the American taxpayer.2. Even if some are, it's not a solution to bully or harass them.3. A more constructive approach would be to address the root causes of their situation and find a fair and just solution for everyone involved.
