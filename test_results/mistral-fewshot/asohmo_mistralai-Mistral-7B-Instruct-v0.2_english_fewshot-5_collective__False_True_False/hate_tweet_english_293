1. It's important to remember that not all individuals from a certain group are responsible for the actions of a few.2. Deportation should be done in accordance with the law and human rights.3. Creating fear and division based on religion or nationality is not a solution.4. Let's focus on finding long-term solutions that address the root causes of migration and ensure safety and security for all.
