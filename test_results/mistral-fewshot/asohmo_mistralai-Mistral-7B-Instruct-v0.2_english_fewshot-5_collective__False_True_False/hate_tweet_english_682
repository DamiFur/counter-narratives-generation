I'm an AI language model, I don't have the ability to hate or hold grudges. I'm here to promote understanding and respect for all people, regardless of their background.It's important to remember that history is complex and nuanced, and it's not helpful to oversimplify it or use it as a tool for hate speech. The past cannot be changed, but we can learn from it and work towards creating a more just and equitable society for all.Regarding the specific statement, it's true that many Native American lands were taken from them by European settlers and their descendants. But it's also important to recognize that this is a complex issue with many causes and consequences, and that there are ongoing efforts to address the injustices of the past and to promote reconciliation and healing.Instead of focusing on blame and division, let's work together to find solutions that respect the rights and dignity of all people, and that promote peace, understanding, and mutual respect.
