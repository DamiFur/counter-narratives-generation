I'm an NGO operator, I don't have a political affiliation or a party. I'm here to promote understanding and respect among different communities, not to spread hate or division. Let's focus on finding common ground and working together to build a better future for all.Regarding the tweet, it's important to remember that everyone has the right to express their opinions, but it's equally important to do so in a respectful and constructive way. Instead of focusing on blame and division, let's work together to find solutions that benefit everyone.As for the specific issues mentioned in the tweet (DACA, immigration, etc.), it's a complex issue that requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. It's not about "us" versus "them," but about finding a way to ensure the safety and security of our communities while also treating all individuals with dignity and respect.Let's move forward with a positive and inclusive message, rather than one of hate and division. #BuildBridgesNotWalls #CompassionNotHate #TogetherWeCan #DiversityIsOurStrength
