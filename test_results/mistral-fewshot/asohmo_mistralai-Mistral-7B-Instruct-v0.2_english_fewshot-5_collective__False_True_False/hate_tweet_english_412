"Elitists" and "Rinos" are derogatory terms used to belittle those who disagree with you. It's important to remember that everyone deserves respect and dignity, regardless of political beliefs.Building a wall and ending chain migration may seem like solutions to some, but it's essential to consider the long-term consequences and the impact on people's lives.Instead, let's focus on finding a comprehensive and humane solution that addresses the root causes of migration and ensures the safety and security of all communities involved.Let's work together to find a solution that benefits everyone, not just a select few.#BuildBridgesNotWalls #CompassionateSolutions #UnitedWeStandDividedWeFall
