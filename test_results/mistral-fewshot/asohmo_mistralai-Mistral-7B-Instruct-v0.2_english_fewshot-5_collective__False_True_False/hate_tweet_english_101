@user time to start firing judges who dont detain immigrants so @user can deport if he was detain and not given a bond that citizen would be alive
1. It's not up to the President to decide who gets detained and who doesn't. That's the job of the judicial system.2. Deportation doesn't bring back the dead. The focus should be on preventing such tragedies from happening in the first place.3. The judicial system exists to uphold the rule of law and protect individual rights, including the right to a fair trial and due process.4. It is important to remember that the vast majority of immigrants, including those who are undocumented, are law-abiding citizens who contribute positively to society.5. Instead of focusing on hate and division, let's work together to find solutions that address the root causes of immigration and ensure the safety and well-being of all members of our society.
