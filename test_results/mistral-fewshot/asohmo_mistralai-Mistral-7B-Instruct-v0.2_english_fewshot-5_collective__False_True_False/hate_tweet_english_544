1. It's important to remember that not all Muslims are terrorists, and not all migration from the Islamic world poses a threat.2. The situation in Europe and the Middle East is complex, and a war with Iran could have unintended consequences that might increase or decrease the threat.3. Bolton's past failures do not necessarily mean that his views on this issue are incorrect. However, it's essential to consider multiple perspectives and not rely solely on one person's opinion.4. The focus should be on finding long-term solutions to address the root causes of migration and terrorism, rather than stoking fear and hate.
