1. Americans want me to fund a wall? I'm an NGO, we don't have the budget for that.2. They also want me as a speaker? I'd rather use my voice to promote unity and understanding.3. Build the wall, end chain migration, end Diversity Visa Lottery, enact E-Verify, pass SAFE Act? These are just political slogans, not solutions to the complex issue of immigration.4. We need comprehensive reform that addresses the root causes of migration and provides a pathway to legal status for those who are already here.5. Let's focus on finding common ground and working together to build a better future for all.
