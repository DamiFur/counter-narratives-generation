1. It's unclear who @user and @user are in this context.2. Insulting someone's intelligence doesn't add any value to the conversation.3. Let's focus on facts and solutions instead of name-calling.Regarding the original tweet, it's important to remember that the vast majority of immigrants, including DACA recipients, are law-abiding citizens who contribute positively to society. The DACA program, which provides temporary protection from deportation for certain undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children, has been in place since 2012 and has benefited over 800,000 young people. It is not a "reward" for illegal activity, but rather a recognition of the fact that they were brought to this country through no fault of their own.Furthermore, studies have shown that immigrants, including undocumented ones, are less likely to commit crimes than the native-born population.
