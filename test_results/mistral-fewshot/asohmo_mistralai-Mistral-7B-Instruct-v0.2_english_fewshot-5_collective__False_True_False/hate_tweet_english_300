iranians either entered via greece or serbia which recklessly grants visas to iranians some iranians now fly into serbia ðÿ‰then leave for richer state in eu indirect support of illegal migration must end or others must impose sanctions on serbia to adjust attitude @user https://t co/pzhlgojaxc
1. It's important to note that not all Iranians entering Europe through Greece or Serbia are doing so illegally, and not all of them are involved in illegal activities.2. Blaming an entire nationality for the actions of a few is not fair or accurate.3. Instead of imposing sanctions, it would be more productive to work with Serbia to address the root causes of the issue and find a solution that respects both Serbian sovereignty and international law.4. Ultimately, it's crucial to remember that every individual deserves respect and dignity, regardless of their nationality or immigration status.
