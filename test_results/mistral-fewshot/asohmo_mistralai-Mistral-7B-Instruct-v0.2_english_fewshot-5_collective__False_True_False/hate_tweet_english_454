1. It's important to remember that not all illegal immigrants are criminals, and not all criminals are illegal immigrants.2. Deporting all illegal immigrants is not a feasible solution, as it would separate families and disrupt communities.3. Ending sanctuary cities, chain migration, and the Diversity Visa Lottery may reduce the number of illegal immigrants, but it does not address the root causes of why people come to the US illegally.4. Mandatory E-Verify could help prevent future illegal immigration, but it would not address the current population of illegal immigrants already living in the US.5. A more compassionate and effective solution would be to provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who meet certain requirements, such as passing a background check and paying taxes. This would allow them to contribute to society and live without fear of deportation.6. It is also important to address the underlying issues that push people to immigrate illegally, such as poverty, violence, and lack of opportunities in their home countries. This can be done through foreign aid, trade agreements, and diplomacy.
