@user must deport all illegal migrants india already reeling under constant threat of muslim radicals curb population
1. It's important to remember that not all illegal immigrants are from India, and not all Muslims are radicals.2. Deporting all illegal immigrants is not a solution to the problem of radicalism.3. Addressing the root causes of radicalism, such as poverty, lack of education, and political instability, is a more effective way to address the issue.4. Deportation is a costly and logistically complex process, and it's not clear how it would address the issue of radicalism in the long term.5. It is also important to note that there are many peaceful and law-abiding Muslims in India and around the world, and it is not fair to stereotype and stigmatize an entire religious group based on the actions of a few.
