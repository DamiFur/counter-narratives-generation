1. "Americans agree with [@user] on immigration" - This is an assumption, not a fact.2. "We can't afford to give [welfare] to [illegals] while U.S. citizens are homeless" - Welfare for undocumented immigrants is limited, and they are not eligible for most welfare programs.3. "Votedemsout" - Voting out Democrats is not a solution to the complex issue of immigration.4. "FamiliesBelongTogetherMarch" - The March for Families Belong Together was a protest against the separation of families at the U.S.-Mexico border, not an endorsement of illegal immigration.
