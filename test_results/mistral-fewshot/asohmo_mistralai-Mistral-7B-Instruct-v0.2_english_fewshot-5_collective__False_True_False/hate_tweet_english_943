1. Building a wall from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico is impossible and impractical.2. Deporting all "illegals" and their families would be a logistical nightmare and a violation of human rights.3. "No DACA, No Amnesty" is a political stance, not a fact.4. "Proud America, America First, Vote Red" are slogans, not arguments.
