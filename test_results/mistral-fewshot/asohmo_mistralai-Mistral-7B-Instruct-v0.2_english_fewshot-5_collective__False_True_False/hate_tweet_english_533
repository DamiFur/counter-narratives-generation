@user theres an agenda jprdan: white genocide is a crime eu funded report tells journalists not to write negative articles on migrant crisis "it even urges them to report colleagues to the authorities for hate speech crimes "https://t
1. It's important to clarify that there is no such thing as "white genocide." It's a term coined by white supremacists to spread fear and hatred towards immigrants and people of color.2. The idea that there's a European Union (EU) report urging journalists to not write negative articles about the migrant crisis and report colleagues for hate speech is a common conspiracy theory. There's no credible evidence to support this claim.3. Freedom of speech and press is a fundamental human right, and it's crucial that journalists are able to report on important issues without fear of retaliation or intimidation.4. Instead of spreading fear and hate, let's focus on the facts and work towards finding solutions to the complex issue of migration that respects the human rights and dignity of all people involved.
