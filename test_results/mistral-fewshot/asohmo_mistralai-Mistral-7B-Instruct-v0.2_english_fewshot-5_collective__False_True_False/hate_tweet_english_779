1. It's important to remember that using harsh language against one group doesn't justify using the same language against another group, regardless of the actions of individuals within those groups.2. Let's focus on finding solutions that address the root causes of violence and crime, rather than stoking division and hatred.3. We should also remember that the vast majority of immigrants, including DACA recipients, are law-abiding citizens who contribute positively to our society.4. It'd be more productive to have a conversation about comprehensive immigration reform that addresses border security, a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and other related issues.5. Lastly, let's not forget that everyone deserves respect and dignity, regardless of their immigration status or any other factor.
