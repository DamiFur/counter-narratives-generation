@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
1. Not all economic migrants pose as refugees.2. Many of them flee from war, persecution, and poverty.3. Turkey is not a safe country for many of them.4. Europe has a moral obligation to help those in need.5. Seeking welfare benefits is not a crime.6. It's important to differentiate between economic migrants and refugees.7. Let's focus on finding long-term solutions instead of spreading hate.
