1. It's important to remember that not all immigrants are the same, and not all of them are a threat.2. The term "white genocide" is a far-right conspiracy theory and is not supported by facts or evidence.3. The idea of "racial replacement" is a racist and xenophobic belief, and it's not based on facts or reality.4. The tweet you're referring to is about soccer players, not immigrants in general, and the majority of them are not French.5. The border security and immigration policies should be based on facts, human rights, and the well-being of all people, regardless of their race or nationality.6. The use of the term "invasion" and "genocide" to describe immigration is inflammatory and dangerous, and it only serves to spread fear and hatred.7. The World Cup is a global event that brings people together, and it should be celebrated as a symbol of unity and sportsmanship, not as a reason to spread hate and division.
