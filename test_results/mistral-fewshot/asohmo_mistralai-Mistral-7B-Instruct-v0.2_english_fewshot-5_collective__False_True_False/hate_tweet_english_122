@user hello?? stop groping my nation schneider: current migrant crisis " represents a plan orchestrated and prepared for a long time by international powers to radically alter christian and national identity of european peoples " http
1. It's important to remember that not all migrants are part of this supposed plan, and many are fleeing from war, persecution, and poverty.2. There is no evidence to support the claim that "international powers" are orchestrating this crisis specifically to alter European peoples' identity.3. Labeling all migrants as part of a nefarious plot is not only inaccurate but also harmful and divisive.Instead, let's focus on finding compassionate and effective solutions to address the root causes of the migrant crisis and ensure the safety and well-being of all people involved.
