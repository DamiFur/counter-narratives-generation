"@user @user the usa is not supposed to make the world a better place it is supposed to make our liberty and earnings safe from politicians and we are not supposed to play world cop either nor are we a rapefugee hostel dumping ground for toxic cultures illegals and the death cult "
1. It's important to remember that not all refugees are the same, and not all of them come from "toxic cultures." Many are fleeing from war, persecution, and poverty, and are seeking safety and a better life for themselves and their families.2. The USA has a long history of welcoming refugees and immigrants, and has benefited greatly from their contributions to society.3. It is not fair or accurate to label all refugees as "illegals" or members of a "death cult." This kind of language is divisive and inflammatory, and only serves to fuel hatred and misunderstanding.4. The USA does have a responsibility to ensure the safety and security of its citizens, but this does not mean turning our backs on those in need. We can and should find ways to help refugees while also protecting our own interests.5. It is important to remember the values of compassion, empathy, and understanding, and to reject hate speech and divisive rhetoric. We are all human beings, deserving of dignity and respect, regardless of our nationality, race, or religion.
