1. It's important to remember that not all illegal immigrants are a burden on society. Many contribute to the economy and pay taxes.2. Deporting all illegal immigrants and their children would be a logistical and humanitarian challenge.3. It is important to address the root causes of illegal immigration, such as poverty and violence in their home countries, rather than just punishing the symptom.4. The term "third world nation" is outdated and derogatory. It is more accurate and respectful to refer to countries as developing or underdeveloped, rather than labeling them as "third world".5. It is essential to remember that immigrants, including illegal ones, are human beings and deserve respect and dignity, regardless of their legal status.6. Building a wall will not solve the problem of illegal immigration. It is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach, including addressing the root causes, improving border security, and providing a pathway to legal status for those who are already here.
