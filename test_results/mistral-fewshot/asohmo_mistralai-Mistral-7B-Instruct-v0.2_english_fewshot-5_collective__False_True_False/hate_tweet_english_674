"Unchecked population and migration" is a complex issue. It's not fair to label an entire group as the "biggest evil" for a country's problems.Instead, let's focus on finding solutions to address the root causes of overpopulation and uncontrolled migration, such as poverty, lack of education, and inadequate infrastructure.Let's work together to create a better future for everyone, rather than spreading hate and division.
