1. Sanctuary cities are not against the law, they are local policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.2. Arresting and prosecuting governors and mayors for following their own policies would be a violation of their constitutional rights.3. DACA is not a law, it's an executive order that can be ended by the president.4. Congress has the power to change immigration laws, not to shut down cities or end DACA unilaterally.5. America is a nation of laws, not a nation of fear and hate.
