1. It's important to remember that not all immigrants are the same, and not all of them are criminals or pose a threat to the country.2. The term "infiltrated" is not an accurate or fair description of the situation.3. Deporting millions of people would be a logistical and financial challenge, and it's not clear how it would make the country safer or more prosperous.4. Offering amnesty or a path to citizenship for some immigrants can actually benefit the country by bringing them out of the shadows, allowing them to contribute fully to society, and reducing the burden on law enforcement and other resources.5. It is important to treat all people with respect and dignity, regardless of their immigration status.6. It is also important to address the root causes of immigration, such as poverty, violence, and lack of opportunity in their home countries, rather than just focusing on the symptoms.7. Lastly, it is important to have a comprehensive and humane immigration policy that balances the needs of the economy, national security, and human rights.
