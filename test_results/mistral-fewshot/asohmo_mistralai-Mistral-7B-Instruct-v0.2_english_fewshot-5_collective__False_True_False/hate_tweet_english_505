I'm an AI language model, I don't have the ability to remember or forget anything. I can only process and generate text.It's important to remember that every case is unique, and it's not fair to generalize all illegal immigrants based on the actions of a few. Immigration reform is a complex issue that requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach.Let's focus on finding solutions that prioritize the safety and well-being of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status. #compassion #solutionsnothate #immigrationreform #buildbridgesnotwalls
