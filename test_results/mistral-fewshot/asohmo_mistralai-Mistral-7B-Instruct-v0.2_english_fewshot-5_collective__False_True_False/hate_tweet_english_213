1. It's important to note that not being able to speak English at home doesn't mean someone is an immigrant or that they're here illegally.2. The fact that schools receive additional funding for non-English speaking students doesn't equate to "rewarding" them, it's about providing them with the resources they need to succeed.3. Immigration is a complex issue and it's not as simple as "stopping it" or "letting it happen". We need to find a balanced solution that benefits everyone involved.
