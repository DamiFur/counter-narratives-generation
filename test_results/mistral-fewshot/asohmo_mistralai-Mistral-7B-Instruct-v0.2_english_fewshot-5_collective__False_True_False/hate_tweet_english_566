@user @user agree with your idea to use the army to build the wall do it hashtag buildthatwall hashtag buildthewall
1. Using the military to build a wall is a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the federal military from engaging in law enforcement activities within the United States, except in certain limited circumstances.2. Building a wall is not a solution to the complex issue of immigration and border security. It is a symbolic gesture that does not address the root causes of the problem.3. The cost of building a wall is estimated to be in the billions of dollars, which could be better spent on other priorities such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure.4. The use of the military for political purposes sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the principle of civilian control of the military.5. There are more effective and humane ways to address the issue of immigration, such as comprehensive immigration reform and increased resources for border security and immigration enforcement.6. The idea of "building the wall" is a divisive and polarizing issue that only serves to further deepen the political divide in our country.7. It is important to remember that immigrants, including those who are undocumented, are human beings with dignity and worth, and should be treated with respect and compassion, rather than being demonized and scapegoated.8. Instead of focusing on building walls, we should be working to build bridges of understanding
