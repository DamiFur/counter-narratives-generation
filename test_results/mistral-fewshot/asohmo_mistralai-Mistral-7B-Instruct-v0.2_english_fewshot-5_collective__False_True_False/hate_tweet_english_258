1. It's important to note that Japan's refugee policy is based on its unique historical and cultural context.2. The number of refugees Japan accepts is relatively small compared to its population and economic capacity.3. Comparing Japan's policy to other countries without considering their specific circumstances is not fair or accurate.4. Refugees are human beings with the right to seek asylum and protection, regardless of the number of requests.5. The focus should be on finding long-term and sustainable solutions to address the root causes of displacement, rather than just limiting the number of refugees.
