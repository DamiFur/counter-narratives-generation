@user time to leave the uk commonwealth and europe that would end immigration people do not want more refugees enough is enough
1. Leaving the UK and Europe won't stop refugees from coming.2. Refugees are not the same as immigrants.3. There's a difference between wanting to stop illegal immigration and hating on refugees.4. "Enough is enough" doesn't justify hate speech.
