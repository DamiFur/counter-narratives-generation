1. It's important to remember that the actions of a few individuals should not be generalized to an entire group.2. There are many factors that contribute to violence and crime, and it's not fair or accurate to blame it solely on migrants.3. Building a wall or implementing stricter immigration policies may not prevent such incidents from happening.4. Instead, we should focus on addressing the root causes of crime and violence, and ensuring that everyone, regardless of their background, is treated with dignity and respect.5. We should also remember that the vast majority of migrants are peaceful and contribute positively to their new communities.6. Let's promote understanding, compassion, and unity, rather than fear and division.
