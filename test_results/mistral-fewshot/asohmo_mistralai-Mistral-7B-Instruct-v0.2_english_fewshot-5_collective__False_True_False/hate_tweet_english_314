1. It's important to remember that asylum seekers have the right to seek protection under international law.2. Not all immigrants become a burden, many contribute positively to society and the economy.3. Stereotyping and generalizing an entire group based on a few individuals' actions is not fair or productive.4. Building a wall is not a solution to the complex issue of immigration, it's a symbolic gesture that does not address the root causes of the problem.5. A more compassionate and inclusive approach is needed to address the challenges posed by immigration, rather than resorting to hate speech and division.
