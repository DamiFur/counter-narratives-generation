orban declares easterneurope free of refugees he says that soros want to make europe to a multiculturell society which is poor https://t co/puqlwnxtyj
"Orban's declaration of Eastern Europe being free of refugees doesn't change the fact that many Europeans believe in a multicultural society. It's important to remember that refugees are people who have been forced to leave their homes due to war or persecution, not a threat to anyone's way of life." #RefugeesWelcome #DiversityIsStrength #NoToHateSpeech #Orban #EasternEurope #MulticulturalSociety #Soros #Europe #HumanRights #HumanitarianAid #Compassion #Empathy #Kindness #LoveTrumpsHate #UnityInDiversity"
