1. It's important to remember that refugees are human beings fleeing from war, persecution, and violence, not just numbers on a budget sheet.2. The nine contractors you mentioned are organizations that help resettle refugees in the US, providing essential services such as housing, employment, and education. They play a crucial role in ensuring the successful integration of refugees into American society.3. Reducing the number of refugees admitted to such a low level would not only be inhumane, but it would also negatively impact these organizations and the communities they serve.4. Instead of focusing on budgets and numbers, let's remember that every refugee is an individual with hopes, dreams, and a desire for a better future. They are not a threat, but an asset to our society.5. Let's work towards creating a more welcoming and inclusive environment for refugees, rather than spreading hate and fear.
