1. It's not fair to stereotype an entire group based on the actions of a few.2. Many immigrants contribute positively to society, including economically and culturally.3. It is important to address the root causes of crime, rather than targeting a specific group.4. Criminal behavior is not exclusive to any one nationality or ethnicity.5. Immigration policies should be based on fairness, human rights, and the best interests of society as a whole.
