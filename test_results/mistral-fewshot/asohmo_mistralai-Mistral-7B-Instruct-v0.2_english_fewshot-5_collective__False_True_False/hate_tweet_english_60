@user for god sake dont put india to danger by unchecked appeasement of ur special community illegal migrants nation is supreme
1. It's important to remember that not all illegal migrants pose a danger to the country.2. The term "appeasement" is often used in a derogatory way, and it's essential to recognize that treating people with respect and dignity is not a weakness.3. The focus should be on finding a fair and just solution for both the illegal migrants and the country's security.4. Fear-mongering and hate speech do not contribute to a productive conversation on this issue.5. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits everyone involved.
