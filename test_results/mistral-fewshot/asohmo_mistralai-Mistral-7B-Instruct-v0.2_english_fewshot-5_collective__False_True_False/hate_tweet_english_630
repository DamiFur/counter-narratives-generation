"Real Canadians" and "illegals" are not mutually exclusive groups. Everyone deserves respect and dignity, regardless of their immigration status.Additionally, it's important to remember that the vast majority of immigrants, including undocumented ones, contribute positively to society and do not pose a threat to Canadians.Furthermore, the term "undefended border" is misleading and inaccurate. Canada has a well-established border security system in place to manage the flow of people and goods across its borders.Lastly, the use of the term "real Canadians" is divisive and exclusionary. Canada is a diverse and welcoming country, and everyone who calls it home is a true Canadian.
