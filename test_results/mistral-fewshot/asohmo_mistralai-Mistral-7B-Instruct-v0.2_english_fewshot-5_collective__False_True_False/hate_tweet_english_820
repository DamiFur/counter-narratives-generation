1. Providing food and water to refugees is not only a moral obligation, but also in the best interest of the host country in the long run.2. The President's role is not just to "send them back" but to ensure their safety and well-being while they are in the country.3. It is important to remember that the vast majority of refugees are fleeing from war, persecution, and violence, and are not a threat to the host country.4. Providing assistance to refugees not only benefits the refugees themselves, but also helps to promote stability and security in the region from which they have fled.5.
