meanwhile in europe nobody speaks the truth that all of the potential millions of migrants and refugees can not be taken into the euro zone former colonial powers like france &amp britain are not without guilt in the creation of the mess that is most of the african continent today
1. It's important to acknowledge the past and its impact on the present, but it doesn't justify hating or discriminating against individuals who are not responsible for historical actions.2. The situation in Africa is complex and multifaceted, and it's not fair to oversimplify it as "a mess created by former colonial powers." There are many factors contributing to the current crises, including political instability, poverty, climate change, and conflict.3. Instead of blaming and hating, let's focus on finding solutions to help those in need and address the root causes of migration and refugee crises.4. And let's not forget that many European countries have a responsibility to help, as they have the resources and capacity to do so.5. Let's work together to build a more inclusive and compassionate world, where everyone is valued and respected, regardless of their background or nationality.
