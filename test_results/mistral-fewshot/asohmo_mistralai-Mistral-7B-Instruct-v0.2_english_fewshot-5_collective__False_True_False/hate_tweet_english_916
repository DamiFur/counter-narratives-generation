1. It's important to remember that not all illegal workers are the same. Some may have come to the US through no fault of their own, such as those who were brought here as children.2. Also, it's not accurate to say that all illegal workers "steal" SSNs and IDs. Some may use fake documents provided by unscrupulous employers or obtain them through other means.3. Lastly, the idea that illegal workers "lower wages" for Americans is a complex issue. While it's true that they may accept lower wages than some Americans, they also often do jobs that many Americans are unwilling to do. Additionally, studies have shown that the overall impact of illegal immigration on wages is minimal.Instead of focusing on hate and division, let's work towards finding solutions that benefit everyone. We can start by addressing the root causes of why people are coming to the US illegally, such as poverty and violence in their home countries, and creating a fair and efficient immigration system that allows people to come here legally and contribute to our economy and society.
