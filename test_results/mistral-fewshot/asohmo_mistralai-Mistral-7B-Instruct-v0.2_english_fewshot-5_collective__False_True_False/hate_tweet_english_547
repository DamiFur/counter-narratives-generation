calais jungle refugees get a grip france they are visitors they have no rights or in a position to demand europe needs to get a grip
1. It's important to remember that refugees are human beings who have been forced to leave their homes due to war, conflict, or persecution. They have the right to seek asylum and protection under international law.2. The term "refugee camp" can be misleading, as it implies that refugees are temporary visitors. In reality, many refugees have been living in such camps for years, with no end in sight to their displacement.3. France, as a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention, has a legal and moral obligation to provide protection and assistance to refugees.4. The situation in the Calais camp is complex and requires a comprehensive solution that addresses the root causes of the refugees' displacement, as well as their immediate needs for shelter, food, and safety.5. Blaming the refugees for their situation and calling them "visitors" or "demanders" is not only inaccurate, but also unhelpful and harmful. It perpetuates negative stereotypes and fuels hatred and discrimination.6. Instead, we should focus on finding long-term solutions to the refugee crisis, such as increasing the number of legal avenues for refugees to enter Europe, providing adequate resources and support to refugee camps, and working to address the root causes
