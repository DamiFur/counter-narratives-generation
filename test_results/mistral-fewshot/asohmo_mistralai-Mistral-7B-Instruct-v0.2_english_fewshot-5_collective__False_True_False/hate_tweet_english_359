1. It's important to note that the Supreme Court has ruled that undocumented immigrants, including DACA recipients, do have some constitutional protections, such as the right to due process and the right to a fair trial.2. Education is not a reward, it's an investment in the future of individuals and society as a whole.3. Sending people "home" is not a simple solution to complex issues, and it's essential to consider the human impact of such a decision.4. The term "illegals" is not an accurate or respectful way to refer to people, and it perpetuates harmful stereotypes and dehumanizes individuals.5. Instead of focusing on division and hate, let's work towards finding solutions that address the root causes of migration and ensure that everyone, regardless of their immigration status, has access to the opportunities and resources they need to thrive.
