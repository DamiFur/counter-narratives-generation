1. It's important to note that not all migrants are illegal, and not all those who overstayed their visas are criminals.2. Creating a special team to identify and deport people is a costly and time-consuming process. It would require significant resources and manpower.3. Deportation can be a traumatic experience for individuals and their families, and it's essential to ensure that the process is carried out humanely and in accordance with the law.4. Instead of focusing on deportation, efforts could be made to address the root causes of why people are coming to the country illegally or overstaying their visas, such as poverty, violence, or lack of opportunities in their home countries.5. Collaboration with the countries of origin to improve border security and create a fair and efficient legal immigration system would be more effective in the long run.
