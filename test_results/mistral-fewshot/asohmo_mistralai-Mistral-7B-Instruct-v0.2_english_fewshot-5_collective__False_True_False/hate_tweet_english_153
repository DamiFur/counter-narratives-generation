comparatively our own inner city youth & fellow americans live like 3rd class citizens while illegals are housed at ice centers that rival the best elementary schools & college dorms in the country hashtag buildthatwall @user @user @user @user @user
1. It's important to remember that everyone deserves basic human rights and dignity, regardless of their legal status or where they come from.2. The situation of inner city youth and fellow Americans is a complex issue that requires comprehensive solutions, not scapegoating and hate speech.3. The comparison between the living conditions of undocumented immigrants in detention centers and inner city youth is not accurate or fair.4. The resources spent on detention centers could be better used to address the root causes of poverty and inequality in inner cities.5. Building a wall or hating on a specific group will not solve these issues. Let's focus on finding common ground and working together to build a better future for all Americans.
