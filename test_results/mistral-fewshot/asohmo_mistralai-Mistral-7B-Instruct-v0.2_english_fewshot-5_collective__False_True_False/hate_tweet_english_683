1. It's unclear who "you" refers to in this context.2. The statement "if we were into Putin" is not related to the previous conversation.3. The term "commie" is a derogatory term used to refer to someone who supports communism, which is a political ideology, not a country.4. There are indeed lawyers in countries with communist governments, such as China and Cuba.
