@user we all know what you mean by scum pal couldnt agree more hashtag sendthemback
"Scum" is a derogatory term. Let's try to use respectful language and focus on facts and solutions rather than name-calling.Regarding the issue at hand, it's important to remember that not all immigrants are criminals, and not all criminals are immigrants. It's crucial to address the root causes of crime and violence, rather than stigmatizing entire groups based on their nationality or immigration status.Additionally, sending people "back" to where they came from is a simplistic solution to a complex issue. Many immigrants have lived in the US for years, have families and communities here, and would face significant challenges if they were forced to return to their countries of origin.Instead, let's focus on finding humane and effective solutions to address immigration-related issues, such as improving border security, providing a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants, and investing in programs that help prevent crime and violence in immigrant communities.Let's work together to find a solution that benefits everyone, rather than resorting to hate speech and divisive rhetoric.
