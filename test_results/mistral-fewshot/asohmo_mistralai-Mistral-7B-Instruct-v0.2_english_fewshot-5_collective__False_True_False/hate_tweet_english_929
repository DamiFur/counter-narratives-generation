@user @user string him up to show the message that you will pay for your crimes in a country where you are not supposed to be in hashtag buildthatwall we are losing our legal citizens to those who should not be here in the first place if they werent here we would still have our loved ones
1. It's important to remember that not all undocumented immigrants are criminals.2. The U.S. is a nation of immigrants, and most of us have ancestors who came here illegally or overstayed their visas.3. Building a wall won't solve the problem, as many immigrants come legally and overstay their visas or enter the country through legal ports of entry.4. Instead of focusing on hate and division, let's work on comprehensive immigration reform that addresses the root causes of migration and provides a pathway to legal status for those who are already here.5. Let's remember that every human being deserves dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status.#BuildBridgesNotWalls #ComprehensiveImmigrationReform #HumanRights #DignityForAll #LoveTrumpsHate
