Let's focus on facts and evidence, not just slogans and hashtags.4. Immigration is a complex issue that requires a thoughtful and comprehensive approach.5. The wall will cost billions of dollars, which could be better spent on education, healthcare, and infrastructure.6. The wall is not an effective solution to the issue of illegal immigration, as people can still enter the country through other means.7. The wall goes against American values of welcoming immigrants and refugees.8. The wall does not address the root causes of immigration, such as poverty, violence, and political instability in other countries.9. Building the wall would be a waste of resources and would not solve the problem of illegal immigration.10.
