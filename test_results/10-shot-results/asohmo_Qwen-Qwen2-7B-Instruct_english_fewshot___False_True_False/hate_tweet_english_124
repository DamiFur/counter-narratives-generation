@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
"Immigrants" are people who choose to come to a new country, they don't belong to any specific country. They have the right to seek a better life in any country they choose.
