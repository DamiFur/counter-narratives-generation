@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
Seeking a better life is not the same as seeking welfare benefits. People have the right to move freely in search of a better future.
