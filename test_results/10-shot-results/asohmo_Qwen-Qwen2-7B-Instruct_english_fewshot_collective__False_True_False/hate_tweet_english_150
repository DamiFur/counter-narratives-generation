Illegal immigration is a complex issue, but it's important to remember that it's not just about votes. It's about the rule of law, national security, and the well-being of communities. The debate around walls and voter ID laws is multifaceted and involves considerations of fairness, security, and respect for the law. It's crucial to discuss these issues in a constructive and fact-based manner, rather than focusing solely on their potential impact on elections.
