@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
Dogs are not the issue here. The discussion should be about the rights and contributions of immigrants to any country they choose to live in.
