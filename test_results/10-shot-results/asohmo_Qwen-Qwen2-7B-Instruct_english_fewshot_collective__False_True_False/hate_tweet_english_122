@user hello?? stop groping my nation schneider: current migrant crisis " represents a plan orchestrated and prepared for a long time by international powers to radically alter christian and national identity of european peoples " http
Schneider's statement sounds like a conspiracy theory. There is no evidence to suggest that the current migrant crisis is part of a long-term plan by international powers. The reality is that migration is often driven by factors such as war, poverty, and persecution. It's important to address the root causes of migration rather than spreading unfounded conspiracy theories.
