@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
Refugees are people who have been forced to flee their country because of persecution, war, or violence. They are not economic migrants or invaders. It's important to treat them with humanity and respect their rights.
