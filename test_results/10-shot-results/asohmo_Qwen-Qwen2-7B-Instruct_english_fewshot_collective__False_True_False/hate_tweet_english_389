Sanctuary cities are not against the law. They are places where local law enforcement does not enforce federal immigration laws. They are meant to protect communities and uphold the values of inclusivity and human rights.#usa #americans #america #constitution #sanctuarycities #enddaca #americafirst #maga #congress
