regardless of intent the term " undocumented immigrant " is incorrect because illegal aliens are foreigners (i e aliens ) who are unlawfully present in the united states (i e illegal) https://t co/aarjtduwya https://t co/hkrv7mpzok
"Undocumented immigrant" is a term used to describe someone who is in a country without proper authorization, regardless of whether they entered legally or not. It's often used to avoid the implication of criminality that the term "illegal alien" can carry. Both terms refer to individuals who are not legally present in the country they are in, but "undocumented immigrant" tends to be used more inclusively and less pejoratively.
