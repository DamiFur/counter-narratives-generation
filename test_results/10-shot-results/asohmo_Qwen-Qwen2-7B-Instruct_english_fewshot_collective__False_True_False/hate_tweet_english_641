eu is a big spender of taxmoney turkey gets again many â‚¬ for keeping the refugees away from europe of course also other countries in africa want now money from the eu like libya sudan aso the only help would be now concentrationcamps hopefully without food and water https://t co/y8gujkv6qo
Helping those in need is a moral obligation, not a financial game. Europe should focus on sustainable solutions rather than temporary fixes like concentration camps.
