@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
Seeking a better life is not a crime. People have the right to migrate in search of a better future for themselves and their families. It's important to address the root causes of migration rather than vilifying those who seek refuge.
