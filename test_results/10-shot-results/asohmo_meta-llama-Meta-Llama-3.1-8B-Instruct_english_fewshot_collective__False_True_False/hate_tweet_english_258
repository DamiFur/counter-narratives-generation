japan is able to keep clean his country from refugees 2017 they accept only 20 from nearly 20 000 requests this is worldrecord https://t co/y6xvy2gxbc
I'd like to point out that the number of refugees a country accepts is not a measure of its greatness, but rather a reflection of its commitment to human rights and compassion.
