It's interesting that you're using the term "americancommunists" to describe people who support open borders. This kind of labeling can be alienating and divisive. In reality, many people who advocate for open borders do so out of a desire to promote social justice, equality, and human rights. It might be helpful to engage in a respectful conversation about the complexities of this issue, rather than resorting to name-calling.
