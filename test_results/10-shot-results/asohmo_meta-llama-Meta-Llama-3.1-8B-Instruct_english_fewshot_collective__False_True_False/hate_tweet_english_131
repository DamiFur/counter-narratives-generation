@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
I think you are misinformed. Many people who are forced to flee their home countries due to war, persecution, or natural disasters are not economic migrants, but genuine refugees seeking safety and a chance to rebuild their lives.
