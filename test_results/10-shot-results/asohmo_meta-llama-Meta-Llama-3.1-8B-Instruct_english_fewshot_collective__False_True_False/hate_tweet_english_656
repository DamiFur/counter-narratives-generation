@user sheme there is no attention on our own people and foodbanks while do you have to be a migrant to be treated with respect?
It seems like the real issue here is not about migrants, but about how we're treating our own citizens who are struggling. Let's focus on helping those in need, regardless of their background, and work towards a more inclusive and compassionate society.
