israel is coming back to africa just 3 months ago african migrants and asylum seekers in israel were going to be forcibly coming back to africa as well hashtag israel hashtag comingtoafrica hashtag ethiopia https://t co/aknbrxhtj1
I'd like to clarify that every person has the right to seek asylum, regardless of their nationality. Forcibly deporting people back to a country where they may face persecution or harm is a violation of international law and human rights.
