It is interesting that Kamala Harris wants to provide lawyers to those arriving at the US border. In many countries, including the US, access to a lawyer is considered a fundamental right, especially for those who are detained or facing deportation. This can help ensure that their rights are protected and that they receive a fair hearing.
