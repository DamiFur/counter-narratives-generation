" spoken like a true globalist a borderless one world government has always been their goal no borders means social mayhem the more chaos they foment the more the public will demand an all powerful superstate ordo ab chao (out of chaos order) is their motto hashtag buildthatwall"
It's interesting that you mention Ordo ab Chao, a phrase often used by those who advocate for a more authoritarian approach to governance. However, isn't it ironic that you're using this phrase to justify building a wall, which is often seen as a symbol of division and separation, rather than unity and order?
