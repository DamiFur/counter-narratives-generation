@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
I think you're trying to distract from the real issue with your question about dogs. The fact remains that every human being, regardless of their nationality, deserves respect and the right to live in the country of their choice, as long as they follow the law.
