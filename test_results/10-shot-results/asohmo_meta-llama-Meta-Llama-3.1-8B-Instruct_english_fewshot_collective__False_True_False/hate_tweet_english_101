@user time to start firing judges who dont detain immigrants so @user can deport if he was detain and not given a bond that citizen would be alive
I'm troubled by the implication that a judge's decision not to detain someone should be based on their citizenship status, rather than the individual's likelihood of flight or danger to the community.
