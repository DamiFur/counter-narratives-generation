@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
You can't equate economic migrants with invaders. Many people leave their countries in search of a better life, not because they want to harm others.
