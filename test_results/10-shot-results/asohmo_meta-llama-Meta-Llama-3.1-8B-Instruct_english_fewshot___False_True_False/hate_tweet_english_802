@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
It's not true that all people who come to Europe are there for welfare benefits. Many are fleeing war, persecution, or natural disasters, just like the "real refugees" you mentioned.
