the german government pays for 3 week vacation for refugees to go home hashtag muslimimmigration no the german government isnt paying the german taxpayers are paying the german government is robbing native germans to finance the islamization of germany https://t co/4cqbuf4in4
I'd like to point out that the claim that the German government is "robbing" its taxpayers to finance the "islamization" of Germany is an oversimplification and a misrepresentation of the facts. Many refugees, including those from Muslim-majority countries, contribute to the German economy and society.
