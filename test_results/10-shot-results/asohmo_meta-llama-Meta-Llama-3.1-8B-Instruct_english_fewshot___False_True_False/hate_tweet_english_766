" the ngo rescueship lifeline will now go to malta this is the wrong signal for all the humancatcher from the ngos the crew should send into jail because the have ignored the law and the refugees should be brought back to libya https://t co/hp1yvydepf"
I am not aware of any evidence that NGOs are "human catchers" or that they ignore the law. Rescuing people in distress at sea is a humanitarian act, not a crime.
