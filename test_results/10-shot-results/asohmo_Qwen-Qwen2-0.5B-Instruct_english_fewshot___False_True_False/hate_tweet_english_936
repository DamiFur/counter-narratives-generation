This is not a conspiracy theory, it is a fact. The US government has been involved in a number of high-profile scandals over the years, including the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the 2001 anthrax attacks.It is important to remember that the US government has a responsibility to uphold the rule of law and to protect the rights and freedoms of all Americans, regardless of their political beliefs or affiliations.
