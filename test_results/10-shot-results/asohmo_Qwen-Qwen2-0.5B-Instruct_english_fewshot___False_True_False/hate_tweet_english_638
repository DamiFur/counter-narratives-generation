ðÿ‡ðÿ‡denmark: ill pay denmark niqab fines: french- algeria n millionaire no go back to algeria better yet tell algeria to open its borders to african migrants instead of europe
Denmark is a country, not a country of immigrants. If you want to pay fines, you have to pay them. If you don't want to pay them, you don't have to. It's up to you.
