Under Obama, illegal aliens were not allowed to apply for asylum, which means they did not have a credible fear of persecution in the United States. Now, they are being released into the country, which is a violation of the law.The hashtag "asylum scam" is misleading and does not reflect the reality of the situation. It is important to support policies that protect the rights of all immigrants, regardless of their status.As for the hashtag "immigration," it is important to understand that immigration is a complex issue that involves multiple stakeholders, including the government, the media, and the public. The hashtag "rednationrising" is not relevant to the current situation and is not supported by the facts.
