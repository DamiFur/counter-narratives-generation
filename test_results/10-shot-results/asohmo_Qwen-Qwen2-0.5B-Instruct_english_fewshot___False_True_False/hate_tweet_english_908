learn from most of hashtag europe thats been hashtag invaded by mostly muslims then look at hashtag italy hashtag poland & others who elected politicians to hashtag stopim migration & hashtag deportillegals hashtag sweden & hashtag germany now trying to reverse the huge mistakes of unlimited migration of ppl who refuse to hashtag assimilate
If you want to learn from history, you should learn from the mistakes of the past, not the present. If you want to stop migration, you should stop it, not the other way around. And if you want to reverse mistakes, you should reverse them, not make them happen again.
