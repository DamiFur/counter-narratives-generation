@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
No, refugees are not economic migrants or invaders. They are people who have been forced to leave their homes and communities due to persecution, violence, or other forms of discrimination. They are often forced to flee their homes in search of a better life, and their presence is often seen as a threat to the stability and security of their host countries.It is important to recognize the reality of refugees and their contributions to society, and to work towards creating a more inclusive and welcoming environment for all people, regardless of their origin or background.
