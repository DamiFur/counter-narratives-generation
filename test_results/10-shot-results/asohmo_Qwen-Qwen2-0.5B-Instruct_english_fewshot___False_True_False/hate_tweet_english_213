Census Bureau's figures are not accurate. It is important to understand the context of the data and its implications.It is also important to note that immigration is a complex issue that involves many factors, including economic, social, cultural, and political factors. Therefore, it is not appropriate to make generalizations about a particular group of people based on their immigration status.Furthermore, the data provided by the Census Bureau is not representative of the entire population and may not accurately reflect the diversity of the American population. It is therefore important to consider other sources of information and data when making decisions about immigration policies.
