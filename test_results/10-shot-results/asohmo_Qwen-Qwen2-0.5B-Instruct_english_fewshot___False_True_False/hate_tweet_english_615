@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
Illegal immigrants who have lived in the United States for years and have been deported are not entitled to asylum. The laws state that they must claim asylum within one year after their last arrival.
