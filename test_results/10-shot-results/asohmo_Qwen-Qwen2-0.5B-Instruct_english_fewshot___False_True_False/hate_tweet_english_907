@user and this is exactly how it should be in england crime is low in slovakia etc but all the scumbags come to to commit crimes as they know they can get away with it - they never return hashtag stop immigration
In England, crime rates are lower than in Slovakia and other countries, so why should immigrants be punished for committing crimes? It's not fair to treat all immigrants the same way.
