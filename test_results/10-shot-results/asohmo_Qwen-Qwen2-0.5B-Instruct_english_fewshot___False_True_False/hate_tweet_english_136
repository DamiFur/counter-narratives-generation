for all the people holding up signs regarding illegal immigrants hand them each a bill to pay the cost of how much these people take from the american taxpayer and i bet they would take down their signs and go home
If you hold up signs for illegal immigrants, you will be held responsible for the cost of their illegal activities, and if you want to leave, you will have to pay for it yourself.
