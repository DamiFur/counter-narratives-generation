Yes, I can think of places that have been improved by large numbers of immigrants or refugees. For example, cities like Berlin, Paris, and Madrid have seen significant improvements in terms of infrastructure, education, and quality of life.However, it is important to note that immigration can also have negative consequences, such as increased crime rates, social tensions, and economic instability. Therefore, it is crucial to balance the benefits of immigration with the challenges that come with it.
