This is not true. The number of refugees working in German hospitals has increased significantly in recent years, and many of them have been trained in Western medicine.It is also important to note that some of the refugees working in hospitals in Germany are not necessarily on the same standard as Western medicine, and some patients may have died as a result of this.
