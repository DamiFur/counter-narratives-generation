amt was disclosed to  the public sad  (fact) | Conclusion:  the first person  (trump ) to pack a  stadium & not  get paid for  it priceless  ( fact) Let's be real here, this isn't about the money, it's about transparency and accountability. If you have nothing to hide, you shouldn't be afraid to disclose your fees. #transparencymatters #accountabilitymatters | Counter-narrativeIt seems like you're trying to deflect attention from the fact that Trump didn't get paid for his speech by bringing up Obama's speech. That's not the point.
