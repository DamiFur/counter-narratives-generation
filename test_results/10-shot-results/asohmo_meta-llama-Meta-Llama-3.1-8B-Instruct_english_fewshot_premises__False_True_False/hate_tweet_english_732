amt was disclosed to  the public sad  (fact) | Conclusion:  the first person  (trump ) to pack a  stadium &  not get paid  for it  priceless   (fact) You are responding to this statement as if you are an expert in counter-narrative. Here is a possible response:"I find it interesting that you're bringing up President Obama's speech as an example. While it's true that he threatened to cancel if the fee amount was disclosed, it's also worth noting that he's a public figure with a long history of transparency and openness about his finances. In contrast, President Trump has been known for his secrecy and lack of transparency, particularly when it comes to his business dealings and tax returns. Let's not forget that transparency is an important value in public life, and it's worth holding our leaders to the same standards, regardless of their party affiliation."
