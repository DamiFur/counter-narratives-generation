amt was disclosed to  the public sad  (fact) | Conclusion:  the first person  (trump ) to pack a  stadium &  not get paid  for it  priceless  (fact ) I see what you're doing here. Trying to create a false equivalence between Trump and Obama. Let's be clear, there is no evidence that Trump ever gave a free speech to a stadium full of people. But Obama did give a free speech at the University of Illinois in 2005, where he was the keynote speaker for the university's commencement ceremony. Would you like to try again with a more accurate representation of the facts?
