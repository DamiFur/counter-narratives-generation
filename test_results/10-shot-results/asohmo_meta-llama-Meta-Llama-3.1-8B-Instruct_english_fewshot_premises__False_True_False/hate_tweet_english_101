@user time to start firing judges who dont detain immigrants so @user can deport if he was detain and not given a bond that citizen would be alive
amt was disclosed to public sad ( fact) | Conclusion:  the first person  (trump )to pack a stadium  &  not get paid  for it  priceless  (fact) This is a classic case of apples and oranges. Let's compare the two. What do we know about the first person's speech and the other person's speech? We know that the first person spoke for free. We know that the other person threatened to cancel their speech if they had to disclose their fee. What does this tell us about the character of these two individuals? It tells us that one person is generous and willing to give back to their audience, while the other person is self-serving and prioritizes their own interests over their audience's right to know. This is not a comparison of their policies or actions, but of their character.
