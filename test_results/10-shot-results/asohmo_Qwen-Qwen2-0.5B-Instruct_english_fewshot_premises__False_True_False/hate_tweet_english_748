:@user the fact that someone doesn't get paid for their speech does not mean that they are bad or that their speech is not valuable. It's just a different situation.What I'm trying to say is that if someone doesn't pay for their speech, it doesn't mean they are a bad person or that they don't deserve to be paid for their work. It just means that their work is not valued enough to warrant paying for it.
