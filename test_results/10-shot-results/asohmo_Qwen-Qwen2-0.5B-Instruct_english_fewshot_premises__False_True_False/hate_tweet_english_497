:@user the fact that someone doesn't get paid for their speech does not mean that they are not good or bad. It's just a matter of perspective.The fact that the first person to do something for free is not necessarily better or worse than the second person to do the same thing for a fee. It's all about perspective.The first person to get paid for a speech does not necessarily mean they are good or bad, but it does mean they are different from the second person.So, the first person is not necessarily good or bad based on whether they get paid or not, and the second person is.So, whether the first person gets paid or not is not a factor in determining whether they are a "good" or "bad" person based on their actions.Therefore, the conclusion is that the fact that a person gets paid does not mean they are bad or good, and the fact that they don't get paid means they are not bad or good.So, based on the information provided, the conclusion would be that the first speaker is not necessarily a good or bad person, while the second speaker is.The first speaker is a good person because they are not getting paid for their work.The second speaker is a bad person because they didn't get paid.So, in conclusion, the first speaker was a good person and the second speaker was a bad person
