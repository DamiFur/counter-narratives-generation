:The first person (Trump) to pay for a stadium and not get paid is priceless, while the other person threatened to cancel the speech if the fees were disclosed. The fact is that the first person paid for the stadium and the other person did not, so the first person is the one who pays for the stadium, not the other person. The other person is threatening to cancel the speaker's speech, not paying for the stadium. The fact that the other person threatens to cancel a speaker's speech does not mean that the speaker is not paid for their speech.
