:@user the fact that someone doesn't get paid for their speech does not mean that they are bad or that their speech is not valuable. It's just a different situation.What I'm trying to say is that if someone doesn't pay for their speech, it doesn't mean they are a bad person or that they don't deserve to be paid for their work. It just means that they are different from the other people who do pay for their work.So if you want to talk about the value of a speech, you should talk about the people who pay for it, not the people who don't.
