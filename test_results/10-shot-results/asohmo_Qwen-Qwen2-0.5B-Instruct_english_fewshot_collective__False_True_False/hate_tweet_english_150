No walls, no borders, and no voter IDs? That's just a bunch of lies. The truth is that illegal immigration is a major problem in the United States and needs to be dealt with. It's not just a political issue, it's a social and economic one. If you want to see the truth, you need to look at the numbers and the facts.
