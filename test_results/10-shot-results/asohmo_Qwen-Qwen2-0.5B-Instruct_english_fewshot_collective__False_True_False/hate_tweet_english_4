rich african countries dont take in african migrants rich muslim countries dont take in muslim migrants rich latin american countries dont take it latin migrants but white countries are suppose to accept them ??
Yes, it is true that some African countries do not take in African migrants, and some Latin American countries do not accept Latin American migrants. However, it is important to note that this is not a blanket statement, and there are exceptions to this rule. For example, some European countries, such as Germany and the United Kingdom, have policies that allow for the admission of certain types of migrants, such as refugees and asylum seekers. It is also worth noting that countries like the United States and Canada have policies that limit the number of immigrants that can be admitted into the country, and this can vary depending on the country and the specific policies in place.
