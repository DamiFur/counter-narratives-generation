No, I don't think it's a good idea to set an annual refugee admission cap of 5,000. It's not sustainable and could lead to a large number of refugees being admitted, which could have a negative impact on the economy and the budget of the nine resettlement contractors. It's important to consider the long-term implications of such a decision.
