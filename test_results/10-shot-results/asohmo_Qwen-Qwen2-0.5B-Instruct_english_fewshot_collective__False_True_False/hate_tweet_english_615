@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
Illegal immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for years and have been deported are entitled to claim asylum within a year of their arrival. The laws state that they must claim asylum within one year. This is a violation of the law and is a form of illegal immigration.
