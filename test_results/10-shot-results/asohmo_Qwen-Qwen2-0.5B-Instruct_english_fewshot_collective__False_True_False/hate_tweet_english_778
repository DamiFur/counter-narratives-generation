"@user @user @user @user @user @user theyve spread to every corner of our country apparently millions (who knows how many really) but millions infiltrated us they must go too all of them hashtag noamnesty hashtag nodaca hashtag b"
This is not true. The vast majority of people in the United States do not participate in illegal immigration. The number of people who have infiltrated the country is not known, and it is not accurate to say that millions of people are infiltrating the country.It is also important to note that the term "illegal immigration" refers to people who have entered the country illegally, such as those who have overstayed their visa or who have committed crimes while in the country. The term "infiltration" refers to the process of people entering a country illegally and then trying to establish themselves there.If you have any questions or concerns about immigration, I would be more than happy to answer them to the best of my ability.
