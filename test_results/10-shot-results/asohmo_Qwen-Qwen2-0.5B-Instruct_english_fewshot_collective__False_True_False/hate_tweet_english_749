problem for the pm re johnson is that a person who sent round vans telling immigrants to go home is not in a position to lecture anyone on racism the lesson of which is: if you pander theyll take everything you give them and keep pushing for more
If someone who sent vans to immigrants is not in the position to teach anyone about racism, then that person is not a racist and should not be lecturing anyone on racism.
