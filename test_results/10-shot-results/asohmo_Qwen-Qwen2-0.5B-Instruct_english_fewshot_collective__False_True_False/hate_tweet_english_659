Under Obama, illegal aliens who claim they have a "credible fear" of coming to the United States have been released into the country without ever applying for asylum. This is a violation of the law and a violation of human rights.It's time to stop the "asylum scam" and deport illegal aliens back to their countries of origin. This is the right thing to do for the sake of humanity and the rule of law.
