canada is an immigrant country dont change it to refugee country please
No, Canada is not an "immigrant country". It is a country that has always been a place of refuge for people fleeing persecution and violence in their home countries. The government of Canada is committed to protecting the rights and dignity of all its citizens, regardless of their immigration status. If you have any concerns about the treatment of immigrants in Canada, please let me know and I will do my best to address them.
