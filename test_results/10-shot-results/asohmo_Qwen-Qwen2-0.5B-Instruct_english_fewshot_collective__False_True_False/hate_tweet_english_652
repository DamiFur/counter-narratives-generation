Yes, I can think of places that have been improved by large numbers of immigrants or refugees. For example, countries like Italy, Spain, and the United States have seen significant improvements in terms of infrastructure, education, and economic development due to the influx of immigrants.However, it is important to note that these improvements are often accompanied by social and economic challenges, such as language barriers, cultural differences, and the displacement of local populations. It is also important to consider the long-term effects of immigration policies on society and the environment.
