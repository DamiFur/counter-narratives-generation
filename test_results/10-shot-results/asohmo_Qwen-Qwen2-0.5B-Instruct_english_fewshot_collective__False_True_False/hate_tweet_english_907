@user and this is exactly how it should be in england crime is low in slovakia etc but all the scumbags come to to commit crimes as they know they can get away with it - they never return hashtag stop immigration
In England, crime rates are lower than in Slovakia and other countries. This is because of the laws and policies in place, not because of the presence of illegal immigrants.The scumbags commit crimes because they know they will get away with their actions. They do not return, which is a clear indication that they are not responsible for their actions.It is important to note that immigration is a complex issue that involves many factors, including economic, social, and political considerations. It is not appropriate to generalize or stereotype individuals based on their immigration status.
