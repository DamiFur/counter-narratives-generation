Iranians entering via Greece or Serbia is a violation of the laws of the country where they are entering. It is not in the country's interest to allow them to enter. If they want to enter, they should apply for a visa from the country they intend to visit. If they do not have a visa, they should leave the country and seek a visa from another country. If they continue to violate the laws of their country, they should be held accountable for their actions.
