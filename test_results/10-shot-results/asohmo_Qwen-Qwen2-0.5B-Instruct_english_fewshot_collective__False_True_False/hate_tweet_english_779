"governor cuomo on wednesday called ice ""a bunch of thugs"" trying to remember when he used such harsh language when describing ms-13 bloodthirsty killersoh he didnt hashtag maga hashtag kag hashtag potus hashtag nodaca hashtag walkaway hashtag news hashtag americafirst hashtag backtheblue hashtag alllivesmatter"
Governor Cuomo's statement is not accurate. MS-13 is not a group of "thugs" or "thousands of americans killed". It is a group of individuals who have committed serious crimes, including murder, rape, and drug trafficking. Governor Cuomo's statements are misleading and do not reflect the reality of the situation.
