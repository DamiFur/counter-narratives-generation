This is not a conspiracy theory, it's a fact. The US government has been involved in a number of high-profile scandals over the years, including the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Watergate scandal, the Monica Lewandowsky affair, and more recently, the Hillary Clinton email scandal. These events have all led to the impeachment of the President of the United States and the subsequent removal of him from office.
