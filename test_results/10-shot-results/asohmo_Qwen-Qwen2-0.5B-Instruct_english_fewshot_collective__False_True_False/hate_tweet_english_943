This is not a call to deport all illegal immigrants and their families, but rather a call for the United States to adopt a policy of "Deport All Illegal Immigrants and Their Families". This is in line with the principles of the United States Constitution, which states that "All men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these Rights are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."
