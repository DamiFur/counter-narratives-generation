@user who care for these children of criminal refugees really they play no role in times of overpopulation
 It's interesting that you bring up the issue of transparency in payment for public speeches, but it seems like a double standard is being applied here. Shouldn't politicians be transparent about their financial dealings, regardless of whether they're speaking for free or for a fee?
