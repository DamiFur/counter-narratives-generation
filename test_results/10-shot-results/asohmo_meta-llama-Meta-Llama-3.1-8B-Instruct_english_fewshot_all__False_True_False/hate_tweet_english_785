 It's interesting that you bring up Trump's past actions as a counterpoint to his current stance on transparency, but let's not forget that the public's right to know shouldn't be tied to a politician's willingness to disclose their own financial dealings. Transparency is a value that should be upheld regardless of personal gain or loss.
