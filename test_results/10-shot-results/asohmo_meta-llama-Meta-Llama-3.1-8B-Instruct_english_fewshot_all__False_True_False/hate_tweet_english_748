 It's interesting that you bring up Trump's past actions, but let's not forget that public figures are often paid for their speeches, and it's their right to disclose or not disclose their fees. The fact that Trump packed a stadium for free doesn't change the fact that he has a history of profiting from his public appearances, just like many other politicians.
