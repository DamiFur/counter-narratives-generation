:the first person to do something is not necessarily the best person to do it. For example, George Washington was the first president of the United States, but that doesn't mean he was the best president. Similarly, just because someone is the first to do something doesn't mean it's the right thing to do. In this case, Trump's decision not to get paid for packing a stadium could be seen as a positive action, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it's the best or most effective way to handle such situations. It's important to consider the context and the potential consequences of such actions, rather than simply praising someone for being the first. This is especially true when it comes to issues like immigration and border security, where there are complex and nuanced considerations that need to be taken into account. #maga #kag #drainthedepstate #obamaspeech #buildthatwall
