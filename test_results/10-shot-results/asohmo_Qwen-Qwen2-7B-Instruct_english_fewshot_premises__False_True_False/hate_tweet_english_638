:The first person to do something is not necessarily the best person to do it. In this case, the fact that Trump packed a stadium without getting paid for it could be seen as a demonstration of his popularity and ability to connect with the crowd, rather than as a measure of his financial acumen. The actions of the "opuppet" (possibly referring to an opponent or a puppet of a political figure) highlight a concern about transparency and potential conflicts of interest, which is a separate issue from Trump's ability to attract large crowds. Therefore, while Trump's action might be seen as "priceless" in terms of its impact or symbolism, it does not necessarily equate to financial efficiency or fairness in the context of disclosed fees for public speeches.
