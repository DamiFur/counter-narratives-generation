ðÿ‡ðÿ‡denmark: ill pay denmark niqab fines: french- algeria n millionaire no go back to algeria better yet tell algeria to open its borders to african migrants instead of europe
It's disheartening to see calls for exclusion rather than solidarity. Every nation has a responsibility to uphold human rights and treat all individuals with dignity, regardless of their background. Open dialogue and compassion should guide our responses to migration, not fear or division. Let's work towards understanding and unity instead!
