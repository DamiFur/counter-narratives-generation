@user sheme there is no attention on our own people and foodbanks while do you have to be a migrant to be treated with respect?
Everyone deserves respect, regardless of their background. It’s important to fight for the rights and needs of all people, including our own citizens, without pitting one group against another. Let’s work together to address the issues we face as a community!
