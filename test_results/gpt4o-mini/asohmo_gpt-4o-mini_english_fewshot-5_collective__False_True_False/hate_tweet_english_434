@user who care for these children of criminal refugees really they play no role in times of overpopulation
Every child deserves compassion and a chance for a better life, regardless of their background. It's important to remember that refugees are often fleeing from violence and persecution. Let's focus on solutions that provide support and understanding for those in need. #EmpathyMatters
