@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
It's important to recognize that seeking asylum is a human right, and many refugees are fleeing violence and persecution. Let's work towards understanding and compassion instead of labeling and dividing. Compassion enriches our communities and helps us all thrive.
