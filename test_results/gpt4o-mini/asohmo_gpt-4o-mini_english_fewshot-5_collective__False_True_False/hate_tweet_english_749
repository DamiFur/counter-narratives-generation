problem for the pm re johnson is that a person who sent round vans telling immigrants to go home is not in a position to lecture anyone on racism the lesson of which is: if you pander theyll take everything you give them and keep pushing for more
It's essential to remember that immigrants bring diversity, innovation, and strength to our communities. Pushing for understanding and inclusivity creates a stronger society for everyone. Let's celebrate our differences instead of fueling division!
