@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
Not every refugee has the luxury of being safe in neighboring countries like Turkey. Many are fleeing violence and persecution and have no choice but to seek safety wherever they can find it. Let's focus on compassion and understanding instead of spreading negativity.
