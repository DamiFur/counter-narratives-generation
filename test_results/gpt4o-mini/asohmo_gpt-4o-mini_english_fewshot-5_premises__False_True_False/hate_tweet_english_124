@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
It's crucial to remember that every immigrant has a story and deserves respect. Let's celebrate the contributions of all people, regardless of their background, instead of reducing them to negative comparisons. Compassion builds stronger communities!
