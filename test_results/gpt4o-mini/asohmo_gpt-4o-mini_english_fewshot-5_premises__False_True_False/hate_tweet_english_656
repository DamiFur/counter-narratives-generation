@user sheme there is no attention on our own people and foodbanks while do you have to be a migrant to be treated with respect?
Respect should be a fundamental right for everyone, regardless of their background. Let's focus on supporting all individuals in need, both citizens and migrants, and work together to create solutions for food insecurity that benefit all. Compassion and empathy should guide our actions.
