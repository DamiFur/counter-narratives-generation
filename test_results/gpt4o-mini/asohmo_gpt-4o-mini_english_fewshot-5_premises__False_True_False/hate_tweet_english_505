Kate Steinle's tragic death sparked a necessary conversation about immigration policy, but it's important to remember that seeking solutions should not come at the expense of compassion and understanding. Building walls may not solve the issues at hand; we need a fair and humane approach to immigration reform. Let's honor her memory by advocating for policies that address the root causes of violence and promote safety for all.
