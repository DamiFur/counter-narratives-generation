@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
Refugees flee from danger and often have no choice in their journey. Many can't safely stay in neighboring countries like Turkey due to dire circumstances. Let's show empathy and support policies that help those truly in need rather than spreading misinformation. Compassion should guide our response.
