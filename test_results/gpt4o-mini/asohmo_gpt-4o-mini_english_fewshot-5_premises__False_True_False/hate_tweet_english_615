@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
It's crucial to understand that seeking asylum is a complex process, and the rules can be nuanced. Rather than labeling individuals, we should focus on creating a fair and just immigration system that takes into account the realities people face. Compassion and understanding can lead to better solutions for everyone involved.
