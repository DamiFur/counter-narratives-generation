@user why is it that illegals that have been in the u s for years that are being deported get to claim asylum when the laws states they must claim aslyum within one year of their last arrival ? stop allowng illegals to game the hashtag immigration s
It's important to remember that every case is unique. Many people fleeing danger or persecution may not be able to claim asylum immediately due to circumstances beyond their control. Instead of demonizing individuals, let's work on creating a humane and fair immigration system that recognizes these complexities. Compassion is key.
