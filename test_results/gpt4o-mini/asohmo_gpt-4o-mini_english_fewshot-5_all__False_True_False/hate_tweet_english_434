@user who care for these children of criminal refugees really they play no role in times of overpopulation
Every child, regardless of their background, deserves compassion and support. Refugees often flee danger and seek safety for their families. Let's focus on empathy and understanding rather than blame. Together, we can build a more inclusive society!
