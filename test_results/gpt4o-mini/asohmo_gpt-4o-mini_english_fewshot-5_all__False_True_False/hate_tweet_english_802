@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
It's essential to remember that many refugees are fleeing dire situations where their lives are at stake. Each person's story is unique, and seeking safety should never be reduced to stereotypes or assumptions. Compassion and understanding pave the way for stronger communities.
