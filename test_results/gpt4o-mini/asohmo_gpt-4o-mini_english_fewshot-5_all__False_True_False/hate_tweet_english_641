It’s disheartening to see such dehumanizing language directed towards those in need. Refugees and migrants deserve compassion and support, not cruelty. Rather than resorting to punitive measures, let's focus on meaningful solutions that uphold human dignity and foster understanding. Compassion should guide our response to those seeking safety and a better life.
