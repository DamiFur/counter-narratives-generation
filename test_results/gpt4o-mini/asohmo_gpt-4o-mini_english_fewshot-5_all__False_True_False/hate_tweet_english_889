"""@user @user @user it may have to do with plain honest speech so many politicians have the """political speech""" bug theyre accustomed to stating what people want to hear & not what they need to like saying it is hashtag fucktarded to believe the mass hashtag refugee / hashtag rapefugee immigration was good is idiodic"" "
