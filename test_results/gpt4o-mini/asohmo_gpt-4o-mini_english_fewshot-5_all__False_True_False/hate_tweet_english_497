@user i just read the guy that broke into many homes including chef jaime oliver was let go but dont call a refugee a rapefugee or the soros sponsored police of the uk will not let you go
It's important to remember that terms like "rapefugee" are harmful and stigmatizing. Labeling an entire group based on the actions of a few only fosters division and fear. Let's focus on justice and understanding, rather than scapegoating vulnerable communities.
