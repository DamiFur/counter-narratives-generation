problem for the pm re johnson is that a person who sent round vans telling immigrants to go home is not in a position to lecture anyone on racism the lesson of which is: if you pander theyll take everything you give them and keep pushing for more
Fear and negativity towards immigrants do not reflect the reality of their contributions to society. Rather than pushing for less, we should celebrate diversity and work together to create an inclusive community for everyone.
