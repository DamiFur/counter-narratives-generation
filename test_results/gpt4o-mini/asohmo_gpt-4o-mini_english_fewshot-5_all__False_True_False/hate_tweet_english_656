@user sheme there is no attention on our own people and foodbanks while do you have to be a migrant to be treated with respect?
Respect should be given to everyone, regardless of their background. Supporting our own communities does not mean we have to dehumanize others. Let's work towards a society where everyone has access to resources and respect!
