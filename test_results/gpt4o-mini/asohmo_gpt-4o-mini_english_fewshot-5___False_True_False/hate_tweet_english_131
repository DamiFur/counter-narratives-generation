@user @user @user wrong none are refugees zero the are economic migrants/invaders colonizing at the expense of host countries while pretending to be "asylum seekers" they are a disaster for the countries that allow this to hap
Labeling people as "invaders" dehumanizes them and ignores the struggles they face. Many seek safety and a chance at a better life. Let's promote understanding and compassion instead of division.
