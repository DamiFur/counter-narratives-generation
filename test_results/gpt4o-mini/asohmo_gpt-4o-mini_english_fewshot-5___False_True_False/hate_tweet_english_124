@user dogs in america or dogs in mexico ?? a mexican asked me whether i was saying that hispanic immigrants had no right to a country meaning ours i replied "immigrants have a country or they wouldnt be immigrants "
It’s important to remember that every immigrant has a story and a reason for seeking a new home. Instead of pitting countries against each other, let’s focus on understanding and compassion. We can build a better society together!
