@user @user @user these boats act like a taxi service for economic migrants posing as refugees and only come to europe to seek welfare benefits of the west ? if they were refugees why not stop at turkey like the real refugees ? instea
It's important to recognize that many individuals fleeing conflict and persecution often face unimaginable circumstances. Their journeys may not be straightforward, and seeking safety in Europe often comes from desperation, not a desire for benefits. Let's advocate for understanding and compassion rather than suspicion. #RefugeesWelcome
