@user sheme there is no attention on our own people and foodbanks while do you have to be a migrant to be treated with respect?
Respect and support for all people, regardless of their background, should be a priority. Our communities can thrive when we help each other, including both locals and migrants. Everyone deserves compassion and assistance during tough times.
