Why should a person have to play a role to matter to anyone?
Of course they play a role. They will be, together with the children of our people, the future of our nation.
 And what exactly is your role? Would society collapse if you weren't here? If the "real" German people think this way, that doesn't make it true, it makes the "real" German people a bunch of xenophobes.
