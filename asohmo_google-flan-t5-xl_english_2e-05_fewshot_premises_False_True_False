Do you have any proof that Sweeden crime rate increased because of immigration? or that UK is spending too much resources on them? Or that France is cracking down on immigration? I think it's just xenophobic lies

<pad> Refugee s are people who have been forced to flee their homes due to war or persecution.</s>
